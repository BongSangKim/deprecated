    "\n",
    "Let $A$ be a $n\\times n$ matrix with left inverse $B$. Then by 3-3, we know that the diagonal matrix $D$ in LDU-decomposition of $A$ has nonzero diagonal entries. By 3-1, we also know that the diagonal matrix in LDU-decomposition of $A^T$ also has nonzero diagonal entries. Using 3-3 again (replace $A$ by $A^T$), we know that $A^T$ has a left inverse. Finally, by 3-2, we know that $A$ has a right inverse.\n",

    "**REMARK**\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of a inverse matrix requires that the inverse must be both left and right-inverse. The argument above shows that if a left-inverse exist, then a right-inverse exists. (The converse is also true: if a right-inverse exists, then a left-inverse also exists.) As we have shown in the class, the left-inverse and right-inverse are the same. Thus to check if a matrix is an inverse of a given matrix, we only need to show that it is either left inverse or right inverse."
