- This movie is rotten, first at all the plot is quite messy, like why not interrupt the story for a dance competition that nobody asked for, why not a obnoxious comic relief,why not include a cliche rescue scene? Why not make a complete ruined movie? Why not put Jonh Cena in this piece of garbage
- It is not often I will give such a high review for a childrena(TM)s movie, however Ferdinand the Bull was outstanding! From originality, animation, cast to the storyline, this was a movie we as a family have now watched over 5 times this year already. Perfection!
- Despite its best efforts, Ferdinand is forgettable and too childish for a grownup audience to enjoy. The story is predicable and the animation is disappointing in comparison to other animated movies recently released. My favorite thing about Ferdinand was Nick Jonas' song Home that plays as the credits role.
- May not be entirely humanistic as first thought when only mostly through the graceful approach to the subject, the film managed to exceed expectations, despite the formulaic predictability and communication, in inviting quality fun, heartwarming entertainment with soulfully charismatic voice-acting from a beneficial cast and bold choices to stir up emotional resonance. (B+)
- Ferdinand is not one of Blue Sky Studios greatest films, like Ice Age or the Peanuts movie, but it is definitely one of the better ones, with an engaging voice by John Cena and showing both the mostly funny and emotional sides of the non fighting bull.
I have to say this though, when El Primero was saying about his body parts being instruments. When he did his over dramatic deep breath before saying "buttocks," I covered my eyes because I knew he would say something relatable to that.
- I watched this because I remember the charming children's book as a kid. Like the Hobbit, the Grinch and other Dr. Seuss short stories padded and puffed up with filler it just doesn't work for me.
From an animation perspective I give it a fail as well. The bright colors of the animation don't serve the setting or the quaint time of the setting well at all. Why is that all 3-d animation has taken on the same style? The motley crew of bulls and hedgehogs (gag) make the story too farcical.
- Much of the film relies on filler and overdone cartoon shenanigans, but both the film's bold message and the voice cast (with John Cena's passionate vocal performance of the titular character being the main highlight) help secure a well-balanced viewing experience for the whole family. It's a refreshing film from Blue Sky Studio, who have certainly exhausted their popular "Ice Age" series.
For younger audiences, this will simultaneously appeal to both the fun and serious sides of their ever-growing minds.
- While initially drawn in my the cute animation, I was pleasantly surprised to find the rest of the movie is quite pleasant too. That's the word I'd use to describe it in general: pleasant. While it manages to be your average, animated family movie, it somehow seems much more enjoyable than most average, animated family movies. It has some good lines, good animation, and a few good laughs. I didn't even find the side characters like the hedgehogs that annoying, which is a first. All in all, I'd recommend it. Not a perfect movie, but an enjoyable one. And sometimes, that's all you need.
- CinemaSins summed it up best: Ferdinand's not bad and it's actually kinda fun. The animation is colourful and incredibly nice to look at, the voice acting is good with John Cena being a perfect choice for Ferdinand since both have reputations of being scary when they're apparently actually quite friendly once you get to know them. I laughed a good couple of times. The same message in every animated kids' movie is there: just be yourself and the movie's fairly predictable. Yet Ferdinand is still a heartwarming entry in Blue Sky Studios' filmography. Really, when they're not busy making Ice Age sequels since...that company refuses to let any franchise rest in peace even when the creators admit that they want it to end, Blue Sky actually aren't that bad and do their best with whatever scripts they have lying around at the moment. And seriously, though that silent, apparently half-man half-machine bull is the best character in the entire movie. Give him his own movie, man.
