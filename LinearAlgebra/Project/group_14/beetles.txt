A Day In The Life
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade.
And though the news was rather sad,
I just had to laugh,
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car.
He didn't notice that the lights had changed.
A crowd a people stood and stared,
They'd seen his face before.
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords.
I saw a film today, oh boy.
The English army had just won the war.
A crowd of people turned away,
But I just had to look.
Having read the book,
I'd love to turn you on.
Woke up fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head.
Found my way down stairs and drunk a cup
And looking up I notice I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat,
Made the bus is second flat. 
- 16 -
Found my way up stairs and hot a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream.
I heard the news today, oh boy.
Four thousand holes in Blackburn Lancashire.
And though the holes were rather small,
They had to count them all.
Now they know haw many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.
I'd love to turn you on.

A Hard Days Night
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
It's been a hard days night,
And I've been working like a dog,
It's been a hard days night,
I should be sleeping like a log.
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright.
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things,
And it's worth it just to hear you say,
You're gonna give me ev'rything.
So why on earth should I moan,
'Cos when I get you alone,
You know I feel O.K.
When I home ev'rything seems to be right,
When I home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah.
It's been a hard days night,
And I've been working like a dog,
It's been a hard days night,
I should be sleeping like a log.
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do 
- 18 -
Will make me feel alright.
So why on earth should I moan,
'Cos when I get you alone,

A Taste of Honey
(Scott/Marlow)
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.
I dream of your first kiss, and then,
I feel upon my lips again,
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.
I will return, yes I will return,
I'll come back for the honey and you.
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,
There lingers still, 'though we're far apart,
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.
I will return, yes I will return,
I'll come back (he'll come back) for the honey (for the honey)
and you.

Across The Universe
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Words are flying out like endless rain into a paper cup,
They slither while, they pass, they slip away across the
universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open
mind,
Possessing and caressing me.
Jai Guru Deva Oh,
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million
eyes,
That call me on and on across the universe,
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box,
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the
universe
Jai Guru Deva Oh,
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world 
- 21 -
Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing through my
open views
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million
suns
It calls me on and on across the universe.
Jai Guru Deva Oh,
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world,
Nothing's gonna change my world 
- 22 -
All My Loving
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you,
Remember I'll always be true.
And then while I'm away,
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you.
I'll pretend that I'm kissing the lips
I'm missing and hope that my dreams
Will come true.
And then while I'm away,
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you.
All my loving I will send to you
All my loving darling, I'll be true.

All You Need Is Love
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
There's nothing you can do that can't be done.
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung.
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game,
It's easy.
There's nothing you can make that can't be made.
No one you can save that can't be saved.
Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time,
It's easy.
All you need is love,
All you need is love,
All you need is love, love,
That is all you need.
There's nothing you can know that isn't known.
Nothing you can see that isn't shown.
Nowhere you can be, that isn't where you're meant to be,
It's easy.
All you need is love,
All you need is love,
All you need is love, love,
That is all you need. 
- 24 -
And I Love Her
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too.
I love her.
She gives me everything
And tenderly;
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me,
And I love her.
I love like ours could never die
As long as I have you near me.
Bright are the stars that shine,
Dark is the sky.
I know this love of mine
Could never die,
And I love her.
Bright are the stars that shine,
Dark is the sky.
I know this love of mine
Could never die,

And I love her.

And Your Bird Can Sing
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
You tell me that you've got ev'rything you want
And your bird can sing,
But you don't get me,
You don't get me!
You say you've seen seven wonders
And your bird is green,
But you can't see me,
You can't see me!
When your prized possessions,
Start to tear you down,
Look in my direction,
I'll be 'round,
I'll be 'round.
When your bird is broken,
Will it bring you down,
You may be awoken,
I'll be 'round,
I'll be 'round.
You tell me that you've heard ev'ry sound there is
And your bird can sing,
But you can't hear me,
You can't hear me!

You give back your ring to me
And I would set you free,
Go with him.

Another Day
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Ev'ry day she takes a morning bath she wets her hair
Wraps a tow'l around her as she's heading for the bedroom
chair.
It's just another day.
Slipping into stockings, slipping into shoes
Dipping in the pocket of her raincoat
It's just another day.
At the office where the papers grow she takes a break
Drinks another coffee and she finds it hard to stay awake
It's just another day,
It's just another day,
It's just another day,
It's just another day.
So sad, so sad,
Sometimes she feels so sad.
Alone in her apartment she'd dance
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell.
Ah stay don't stand around and he comes and he comes
But he leaves the next day.
So sad.
Sometimes she feels so sad.
As the post another letter to the sound of five 
- 30 -
People gather round her and she finds it hard to stay alive
It's just another day,
It's just another day,
It's just another day,
It's just another day.
So sad, so sad,
Sometimes she feels so sad.
Alone in her apartment she'd dance
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell.
Ah stay don't stand around and he comes and he comes
But he leaves the next day.
So sad.
Sometimes she feels so sad.
Ev'ry day she takes a morning bath she wets her hair
Wraps a tow'l around her as she's heading for the bedroom
chair.
It's just another day,
It's just another day,
It's just another day,
It's just another day.

Another Girl
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
For I have got another girl, another girl.
You've making me say that I've got nobody but you,
But as from today, well I've got somebody that's new.
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl, another girl.
She sweeter than all the girls and I've met quite a few.
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do,
And so I'm telling you, this time you'd better stop,
For I have got another girl,
Another girl, who will love me till the end.
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend.
I don't wanna say that I've been unhappy with you,

Ask Me Why
(Lennon/McCartney)
I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know.
And it's true that it really only goes to show,
That I know,
That I, I, I, I should never, never, never be blue.
Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry.
And in time, you'll understand the reason why,
If I cry,
It's not because I'm sad, but you're the only love that I've ever
had.
I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more misery.
Ask me why, I'll say I love you,
And I'm always thinking of you.

Eleanor Rigby

Ah, look at all the lonely people,
Ah, look at all the lonely people.
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church
Where a wedding has been,
Lives in a dream,
Waits at the window, wearing the face
That she keeps in a jar by the door,
Who is it for?
All the lonely people, where do they all come from?
All the lonely people, where do they all belong?
Farther McCenzie, writing the words of a sermon
That no one will hear,
No one comes near.

All the lonely people, where do they all belong?

Fixing A Hole
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go.
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go.
And it really doesn't matter
If I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there
Who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door.
I'm painting the room in a colourful way
And when my mind is wandering,
There I will go.
And it really doesn't matter
If I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong.
See the people standing there
Who disagree and never win

And wonder why they don't get in my door.

For No One
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Your day breaks, your mind aches,
You find that all her words
Of kindness linger on when she no longer needs you.
She wakes up, she makes up,
She takes her time and doesn't
Feel she has to hurry she no longer needs you.
And in her eyes you see nothing,
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one.
A love that should have lasted years.
You want her, you need her,
And yet you don't believe her
When she says her love is dead you think she needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing,
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one.
A love that should have lasted years.
You stay home, she goes out,
She says that long ago
She knew someone but now he's gone, she doesn't need him.
Your day breaks, your mind aches,
There will be times 
- 77 -
When all the things you said will fill your head, you won't
forget her.
And in her eyes you see nothing,
No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one.
A love that should have lasted years.

Free As A Bird
(Lennon/McCartney/Harrison/Starkey)
Free as a bird,
It's the next best thing to be free as a bird.
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly, as a bird on wings
Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Can we really live without each other
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much
It always made me feel so
Free as a bird,
It's the next best thing to be free as a bird.
Home home and dry
Like a homing bird I fly--a bird on wing
Whatever happened to the life that we once knew
Always made me feel soooo
Free
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird

From A Window
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Late yesterday night I saw a light shine from a window,
And as I looked again your face came into sight.
I couldn't walk on until you'd gone from your window.
I had to make you mine I knew you were the one.
Oh I would be glad just to love a love like that,
Oh I would be true and I'd live my life for you.
So meet me tonight just where the light shines from a window,
And as I take your hand say that you'll be mine tonight.

Girl
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Is there anybody going' to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's a kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry;
Still, you don't regret a single day.
Ah, girl!
When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her,
She will turn to me and start to cry.
And the promises the earth to me and I believe her,
After all this time I don't know why.
Ah, girl!
She's a kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there,
You feel a fool.
When you say she's looking good she acts as if it's understood,
She's cool, cool, cool, cool.
Ah, girl!
Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to
pleasure.
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?
Ah, girl!

And I get to the bottom 
- 107 -
And I see you again, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Will you won't you, want me to make you

Here Comes The Sun
(G. Harrison)
Here comes the sun,
Here comes the sun,
And I say "It's all right"
Little darling, it's been a long, cold lonely winter.
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here.
Here comes the sun,
Here comes the sun,
And I say "It's all right"

Here There And Everywhere
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
To lead a better life,
I need my love to be here.
Here making each day of the year,
Changing my life with a wave of her hand.
Nobody can deny that there's something there.
There, running my hands through her hair;
Both of us thinking how good it can be.
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there.
I want her ev'rywhere, and if she's beside me
I know I need never care,
But to love her is to meet her ev'rywhere,
Knowing that love is to share,
Each one believing that love never dies,
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there.
I want her ev'rywhere, and if she's beside me
I know I need never care,
But to love her is to meet her ev'rywhere,
Knowing that love is to share,
Each one believing that love never dies,
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there. 
- 112 -
To be there and ev'rywhere,
Here, there and ev'rywhere.

Hey Bulldog
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Sheep dog standing in the rain,
Bullfrog doing it again,
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles,
What makes you think you're something special when you
smile?
Child like no one understands,
Jack knife in your sweaty hands,
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years,
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears.
Big man walking in the park,
Wigwam frightened of the dark,
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you.
You think you know it but you haven't got a clue.
You can talk to me, you can talk to me,
You can talk to me if you're lonely you can talk to me.
Hey Bulldog. 
- 114 -
Hey Jude
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Hey Jude, don't make it bad,
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.
Hey Jude, don't be afraid,
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.
And any time you feel the pain,
Hej Jude, refrain,
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
For now you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool by making his world a little colder.
Da da da da da da da da da da
Hey Jude, don't let me down,
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.
So let it out and let it in,
Hey Jude, begin,
You're waiting for someone to perform with, 
- 115 -
And don't you know that it's just you,
Hej Jude, you'll do.
The movement you need is on your shoulder.
Da da da da da da da da da da
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember, to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it better
Hey Jude, Hey Jude

'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you.
Just to dance with you is ev'rything I need.
Before this dance is through I think I'll love you too,
I'm so happy when you dance with me.
I'm somebody tries to take my place,
Let's pretend we just can't see his face,
In this world there's nothing I would rather do,
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you.
Just to dance with you is ev'rything I need.

I'm In Love
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
I've got something to tell you
I'm in love,
I've been longing to tell you
I'm in love.
You'll believe me when I tell you
I'm in love with you.
You're my kind of girl,
You make me feel proud,
You make me want to shout aloud.
Yes, I'm telling all my friends
I'm in love.
Ev'ry night I can't sleep thinking of you,
And ev'ry little thing that you do.
Yes, I'm telling all my friends
I'm in love.
Oh, yes, I'm sittin' on top of the world,
I'm in love with a wonderful girl.
And I never felt so good before
If this is love give me more more more more.

I'm Looking Through You
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
I'm looking through you,
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you,
What did I know?
You don't look diff'rent,
But you have changed.
I'm looking through you,
You're not the same.
Your lips are moving,
I cannot hear;
Your voice is soothing,
But the words aren't clear
You don't sound diff'rent,
I've learned the game
I'm looking through you,
You're not the same.
Why, tell me why did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight.
You're thinking of me
The same old way.
You were above me,
But not today. 
- 162 -
The only diff'rence
Is you're down there.
I'm looking through you,
And you're nowhere.
Why, tell me why did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight.
I'm looking through you,
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you,
What did I know?
You don't look diff'rent,
But you have changed.
I'm looking through you,
You're not the same.

I'm Only Sleeping
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
When I wake up early in the morning,
Lift my head, I'm still jawning.
When I'm in the middle of a dream,
Stay in bed, float up stream.
Please don't wake me, no don't shake me,
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping.
Ev'rybody seems to think I'm lazy,
I don't mind, I think they're crazy.
Running ev'rywhere at such a speed
'Til they find there's no need.
Please don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all
I'm only sleeping.
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window,
Taking my time,
Lying there and staring at the ceiling,
Waiting for a sleepy feeling.
Please don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all 
- 164 -
I'm only sleeping.
When I wake up early in the morning,
Lift my head, I'm still jawning.
When I'm in the middle of a dream,
Stay in bed, float up stream.
Please don't wake me, no don't shake me,
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping.

I'm So Tired
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
I'm so tired,
I haven't slept a wink,
I'm so tired,
My mind is on the blink.
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink, no, no, no.
I'm so tired,
I don't know what to do,
I'm so tired,
My mind is set on you.
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do.
You say I'm putting you on,
But it's no joke,
It's doing me harm,
You know I can't sleep,
I can't stop my brain,
You know it's three weeks,
I'm going insane,
You know I'd give you ev'rything I've got
For a little peace of mind. 
- 166 -
In My Life
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed,
Some forever, not for better,
Some have gone and some remain.
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall.
Some are dead and some are living,
In my life I've loved them all.
But of all these friends and lovers,
There's no one compares with you,
And these mem'ies lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new.
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before,
I know I'll often stop and think about them,
In my life I'll love you more.
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before,
I know I'll often stop and think about them,
In my life I'll love you more.
In my life I'll love you more.

It's All Too Much
(G. Harrison)
When I look into your eyes,
Your love is there for me.
And the more I go inside,
The more there is to see.
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you.
Ev'rywhere it's what you make for us
To take it's all too much.
Floating down the stream of time,
From life to life with me.
Makes no diff'rence where you are
Or where you'd like to be.
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you.
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece, but not too much
Sail me on a silver sun,
Where I know that I'm free.
Show me that I'm ev'rywhere
And get me home for tea. 
- 171 -
It's all too much for me to take:
There's plenty there for ev'rybody.
The more you give the more you get,
The more it is and it's too much.
It's all too much. 
- 172 -
It's For You
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
I'd say some day
I'm bound to give my heart away
When I do this for you.
They said that love was a lie,
Told me that I
Should never try to find
Somebody who'd be kind,
Kind to only me.
You love, true love
Seems to be all
I'm thinking of,
But it's true, it's for you.
So I just tell them they're right
Who wants a fight?
Tell them I quite agree
Nobody'd love me
Then I look at you.
And love comes, love shows,
I give my heart and no one knows
That I do; it's for you. 
- 173 -
It's Only Love
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
I get high when I see you go by, my, oh, my!
When you sigh my my inside just flies, butterflies,
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?
It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's on;y love and that is all,
But it's so hard loving you.
Is it right that you and I should fight ev'ry night?
Just the sight of you makes night-time bright, very bright.
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?
It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love and that is all,
But it's so hard loving you,
Yes, it's so hard loving you, loving you. 
- 174 -
I've Got A Feeling

And if you leave me I won't be late again, oh no, oh no, yeah,
yeah.

And that I was looking for was somebody who looked like you.
I've got a feeling that keeps me on my toes, oh yeah, oh yeah.
I've got a feeling I think that everybody knows, oh yeah, oh
yeah, yeah, yeah.
I've got a feeling, yeah.
Ev'rybody had a hard year,
Ev'rybody had a good time;
Ev'rybody had a wet dream,
Ev'rybody saw the sunshine.
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
Ev'rybody had a good year, 
- 175 -
Ev'rybody let their hair down,
Ev'rybody pulled their socks up,
Ev'rybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

I've Just Seen A Face
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
I've just seen a face I can't forget the time or place where we
does met,
She's just the girl for me and I want all the world to see we're
met.

And I'd have never been aware but as it is I'll dream of her

Da da da da da da.
Falling, yes I am falling,

Julia
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Half of what I say is meaning less
But I say is just to reach you, Julia.
Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me.
So I sing a song of love, Julia.
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me.
So I sing a song of love, Julia.
Her hair of floating sky is shimmering,
Glimmering in the sun.
Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me.
So I sing a song of love, Julia.
When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia.
Julia, sleeping sand, silent clouds, touch me.
So I sing a song of love, Julia.
Mm mm mm calls me.
So I sing a song of love, Julia,
Julia, Julia.

Lady Madonna
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet?
Who finds the money when you pay the rent,
Did you think that money was haven't sent?
Friday night arrives without a suitcase,
Sundayn morning creeping like a nun,
Monday's child has learned to tie his booflace.
See how they run.
Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonder how you manage to feel the rest?
See how they run.
Lady Madonna lying on the bed,
Listen to the music playing in your head.
Tuesday afternoon is never ending,
Wednesday morning papers didn't come,
Thursday night your stocking needed mending.
See how they run.
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet?

Let It Be
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me,
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me,
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be,
Let it be, let it be,
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
And when the broken-hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see,
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be,
Let it be, let it be,
There will be an answer, let it be.
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine until tomorrow, let it be. 
- 183 -
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me,
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be,
Let it be, let it be,
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be,
Let it be, let it be,
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

I'm so sad and lonely;
Baby, take a chance with me.
Little child, little child,
Little child, won't you dance with me?

(G. Harrison)
It's been a long, long, long time
How could I ever have lost you
When I loved you.
It took a long, long, long time
Now I'm so happy I found you
Now I love you.
So many tears I was searching
So many tears I was wasting, oh, oh.
No I can see you, be you
Now can I ever misplane you
How I want you
Oh, I love you
You know that I need you
Oh, I love you

Love You To
(G. Harrison)
Each day just goes so fast,
I turn around, it's past,
You don't get time to hang a sing on me.
Love me while you can,
Or I'll get a plan.
A lifetime is so short,
A new one can't be bought,
And what you've got means such a lot to me.
Make love all day long, make love singing songs.
Make love all day long, make love singing songs.
There's people standing 'round
Who'll throw you in the ground.
They'll fill you in with all the things you'll see.
I'll make love to you if you want me to.

Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Celophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes and she's gone.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Ev'ryone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds and you're
gone.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, 
- 189 -
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking-glass ties.
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Aaaah,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Aaaah,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Martha My Dear
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Martha, my dear, though I spend my days
In coversation please remember me,
Martha, my love,
Don't forget me, Martha, my dear.
Hold your head up, you silly girl,
Look what you've done.
When you find yourself in the thick of it,
Help yourself to a bit
Of what is all around you.
Silly girl,
Take a good look around you,
Take a good look you've bound to see
That you and me were meant to be
For each other, silly girl.

Maxwell's Silver Hammer
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Joan was quizzical,
Studied pataphysical
Science in the home.
Late nights all alone with a test tube,
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Maxwell Edison,
Majoring in medicine,
Calls her on the phone.
"Can I take you out to the pictures,
Jo-o-o-oan?"
But, as she's getting ready to go,
A knock comes on the door.
Bang! Bang!
Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head.
Clang! Clang!
Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead.
Back in school again,
Maxwell plays the fool again,
Teacher gets annoyed.
Wishing to avoid
An unpleasant sce-e-e-ene.
She tells Max to stay
When the class has gone away, 
- 192 -
So, he waits behind.
Writing fifty times,
"I must not be so-o-o-o."
But, when she turns her back on the boy,
He creeps up from behind.
Bang! Bang!
Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head.
Clang! Clang!
Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead.
P.C. Thirty one
Said, "We're caught a dirty one."
Maxwell stands alone.
Painting testimonial pictures,
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Rose and Valerie,
Screaming from the gallery,
Say he must go free.
The judge does not agree
And he tells them so-o-o-o.
But, as the words are leaving his lips,
A noise come from behind.
Bang! Bang!
Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon his head.
Clang! Clang!
Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that he was dead.

Mean Mr. Mustard
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Mean mr. Mustard sleeps in the park,
Shaves in the dark, trying to save paper.
Sleeps in a hole in the road;
Saving up to buy some clothes;
Keeps a ten bob note up his nose.
Such a mean old man,
Such a mean old man.
His sister Pam works in a shop,
She never stops, she's a go getter.
Takes him out to look at the Queen;
Only place that he's ever been.
Always shouts out something obscene.
Such a dirty old man,
Dirty old man.

Misery
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
You've been treating me bad, Misery.
I'm the kind of guy
Who never used to cry,
But now you're treating me bad, Misery.
I've lost you now I'm sure,
I won't see you no more.
It's gonna be a drag, Misery.
I remember all the little things we've done.
You'll remember and you'll be the lonely one, lonely one.
Please come back to me,
'Cause ev'ryone can see
Without you I will be in misery. 
- 199 -
No Reply
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
This happened once before
When I came to your door,
No reply,
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you
Peep through your window.
I saw the light,
I saw the light.
I know that you saw me
'Cause I looked up to see your face.
I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
That's a lie,
'Cause I know where you've been,
I saw you walk in you door.
I nearly died,
I nearly died,
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man
In my place. 
- 200 -
If I were you
I'd realize
That I love you more that any other guy,
And I'll forgive
That I heard before
When you gave me no reply.
I tried to telephone,
They said you were not home,
That's a lie,
'Cause I know where you've been,
I saw you walk in you door.
I nearly died,
I nearly died,
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man
In my place.
No reply, no reply.

Nobody I Know
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Nobody I know could love me more that you.
You can give me so much love it seems untrue.
Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree
And then when you've heard him see if you agree.
Nobody I know could love you more than me.
Ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through.
Ev'ryone I know is sure it shines for you.
Even in my dreams I look into your eyes,
Suddenly it seems I've found a paradise.
Ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through.
It means so much to be a part of a heart of a wonderful one.
When other lovers are gone,
We'll live on, we'll live on.
Nobody I know could love me more that you.

Norwegian Wood
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
I once had girl,
Or should I say,
She once had me;
She showed me her room,
Isn't it good,
Norwegian wood?
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere.
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair.
I sat on a rug,
Biding my time,
Drinking her wine,
We talked until two,
And then she said,
"It's time for bed."
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath.
And when I awoke,
I was alone,
This bird had flown;
So I lit a fire,
Isn't it good,
Norwegian wood? 
- 203 -
Not A Second Time
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wond'ring why.
I cried for you.
And now you've changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine.
I cried, it's through.
Oh, you're giving me the same old line,
I'm wond'ring why.
You hurt me then,
You're back again.
No, no, no,
Not a second time.
You know you made me cry,
I see no use in wond'ring why.
I cried for you.
And now you've changed your mind,
I see no reason to change mine.
I cried, it's through.
Oh, not a second time.

Nowhere Man
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
He's a real nowhere man,
Sitting in his nowhere land,
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.
Doesn't have a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to,
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere man, please listen,
You don't know what you're missing,
Nowhere man, the world is at your command.
He's a blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see,
Nowhere man can you see me at all?
Nowhere man, don't worry,
Take your time, don't hurry,
Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand.
Doesn't have a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to,
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere man, please listen,

Octopus's Garden
(R. Starkey)
I'd like to be under sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade.
He'd let us in knows where we've been
In his octopus's garden in the shade.
I'd ask my friends to come and see
An octopus's garden with me.
I'd like to be under sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade.
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide away beneath the waves.
Resting our heads on the sea bed
In an octopus's garden near a cave.
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can't be found.
I'd like to be under sea
In an octopus's garden in the shade.
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves.
Oh what a joy for ev'ry girl and boy 
- 209 -
Knowing they're happy and they're safe.
We would be so happy you and me,
No one there to tell us what to do.
I'd like to be under sea
In an octopus's garden with you.
In an octopus's garden with you.
In an octopus's garden with you.

One After 909
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
My baby says she's trav'ling on the one after 909.
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line.
I said move over once, move over twice,
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909.
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees.
You're only fooling around, you're only fooling around with
me.
I said move over once, move over twice,
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909.
I've got my bag,
Run to the station.
Railman says
You've got the wrong location.
I've got my bag,
Run right home.
Then I find

Only A Nothern Song
(G. Harrison)
If you're list'ning to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong.
But they're not.
He just wrote it like that.
When you're list'ning late at night,
You may think the bands are not quite right.
But they are.
They just play it like that.
It doesn't really matter what chords I play,
What words I say or time of day it is,
As it's only a Northern Song.
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I tare or if my hair is brown,
When it's only a Northern Song.
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key,
You're correct,
There's nobody there.
And I told you there's no one there.

Paperback Writer
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Dear Sir or Madam will you read my book?
It took me years to write, will you take a look?
Based on a novel by a man named Lear
And I need a job so I want to be a paperback writer, paperback
writer.
It's the dirty story of a dirty man,
And his clinging wife doesn't understand.
His son is working for the Daily Mail,
It's a steady job, but he wants to be a paperback writer,
paperback writer.
It's thousand pages, give or take a few.
I'll be writing more in a week or two.
I can make it longer if you like the stile,
I can change it 'round and I want to be a paperback writer,
paperback writer.
It you really like it you can have the things,
It could make a million for you overnight.
If you must return it you can send it here,
But I need a break and I want to be a paperback writer,
paperback writer.

Penny Lane
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of ev'ry head he's had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go stop and say hello.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
Wet behind the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
On the corner is a banker with a motor car.
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a "mac" in the pouring rain, very
strange.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
Wet behind the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hour glass.
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, it's a clean machine.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
Full of fish and finger pies
In summer meanwhile back
In Penny Lane the barber shawes another customer.
We see the baner sitting, waiting for a trend. 
- 217 -
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain, very
strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
Wet behind the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
Wet behind the blue suburban skies,
Penny Lane.

Rain
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads
The night as well be dead
If the rain comes,
If the rain comes.
When the sun shines, they sleep in the shade
And sip their lemonade
When the sun shines,
When the sun shines.
Rain, I don't mind,
Shine, the weather's fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain
Everything's the same
I can show you,
I can show you.
Rain, I don't mind,
Shine, the weather's fine.
Can you hear me that when to rains
And shines it's just a state
Can you hear me,

Real Love
(John Lennon)
All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you
Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
It's real love
It's real, yes it's real love
It's real
From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love
Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid 
- 228 -
It's real love
It's real, yes it's real love
It's real
Thought I'd been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
It's real love
Yes it's real, yes it's real love
It's real, yes it's real love...

Revolution
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
You say you want a revolution,
Well, you know, we all want to change the world.
You tell me that it's evolution,
Well, you know, we all want to change the world.
But when you talk about destruction,
Don't you know that you can count me out
Don't you know it's gonna be alright.
You say you got a real solution,
Well, you know, we'd all love to see the plan.
You asked me for a contribution,
Well, you know, we're doing what we can.
But when you want money for people with minds that hate,
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait.
Don't you know it's gonna be alright.
You say you'll change the constitution,
Well, you know we all want to change your head.
You tell me it's the institution,
Well, you know you better free your mind instead.
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao,
You ain't going to make it with anyone, anyhow.
Don't you know it's gonna be alright.

Rock'n'Roll Music
(Chuck Berry)
Just let me hear some of that
Rock'n'roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock'n'roll music
If you wanna dance with me,
If you wanna dance with me.
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beaty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony.
That's why I go for that
Rock'n'roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock'n'roll music
If you wanna dance with me,
If you wanna dance with me.
I took my loved one over'cross the tracks
So she can hear my man a wail a sax 
- 231 -
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were going like a hurrican.
That's why I go for that
Rock'n'roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock'n'roll music
If you wanna dance with me,
If you wanna dance with me.
Way down south they had a jubilee
The jokey folks they had jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a water cup
The folks dancing got all chook up
And started playing that
Rock'n'roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock'n'roll music
If you wanna dance with me,
If you wanna dance with me.
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the wood to hear a mambo
It's way too early for a congo 
- 232 -
So keep a rocking that piano
That's why I go for that
Rock'n'roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock'n'roll music
If you wanna dance with me,
If you wanna dance with me.

She Came In Through The Bathroom Window
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
She came in through the bathroom window,
Protected by a silver spoon.
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
By the banks of her own lagoon.
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday;
Tuesday's on the phone to me.
She said she'd always been a dancer,
She worked at fifteen clubs a day.
And though she thought I knew the answer;
Well, I knew that I could not say.
And so I quit the police department,
And got myself a steady job.
And though she tried her best to help me;
She could steal, but she could not rob.
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday;
Tuesday's on the phone to me.

That I will never leave her,
She don't give boys the eye.
She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin',
Don't ask me why.
She's a woman who understands,
She's a woman who loves her man.
My love don't give me presents,
I know that she's no peasant,
Only ever has to give me love forever and forever, 
- 248 -
My love don't give me presents.
Turn me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only foolin',
I know she isn't.
She's a woman who understands,
She's a woman who loves her man.
She don't give boys the eye,
She hates to see me cry,
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her,
She don't give boys the eye.
She will never make me jealous,
Gives me all her time as well as lovin',
Don't ask me why.
She's a woman, she's a woman.

She's Leaving Home
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Wedn'sday morning at five o'clock as the day begins,
Silently closing her bedroom door,
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more.
She goes down stairs to the kitchen clutching her hand
kerchief.
Quietly turning her back door key,
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her ev'rything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone for so many years.
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing down.
Pick up the letter that's lying there,
Standing alone at the top of the stairs.
She breaks down and cries to her husband "Daddy, our baby's
gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly,
How could she do this to me."
She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought of ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone for so many years. 
- 250 -
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away.
Waiting to keep the appointment she made,
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She (What did we do that was wrong)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied for so many years.
She's leaving home, bye, bye. 
- 251 -
Something
(G. Harrison)
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover.
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how.
Something in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover.
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how.
You're asking me will my love grow,
I don't know, I don't know.
You stick around now it may show,
I don't know, I don't know.
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her.
Something in the thing she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how.

Step Inside Love
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Step inside, love, let me find you a place
Where the cares of the day
Will be carried away by the smile on your face.
We are together now and forever, come my way.
Step inside, love and stay, step inside, love.
Step inside, love, step inside, love, I want you to stay.
You look tired love, let me turn down the light,
Come in out of the cold,
Rest your head on my shoulder and love me tonight.
I'll always be here if you should need me, night and day.
Step inside, love and stay, step inside, love.
Step inside, love, step inside, love, I want you to stay.
When you leave me, say you'll see me again,
For I'll know in my heart
We will not be apart and I'll miss you till then.
We'll be together now and forever, come my way.
Step inside, love and stay, step inside, love.
Step inside, love, step inside, love, I want you to stay.

Strawberry Fields Forever
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Let me take you down 'cause I'm going to strawberry fields.
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever.
Living is easy with eyes closed.
Misunderstanding all you see.
It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me.
Let me take you down 'cause I'm going to strawberry fields.
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever.
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low.
That is you know you can't tune in but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad.
Let me take you down 'cause I'm going to strawberry fields.
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever.
Always know, sometimes think it's me.
But you know I know and it's a dream.
I think I know of thee, ah, yes but it's all wrong. 
- 255 -
That is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down 'cause I'm going to strawberry fields.
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever,
Strawberry fields forever,
Strawberry fields forever.

Taxman
(G. Harrison)
Let me tell you how it will be.
There's one for you, nineteen for me.
'Cause I'm the taxman,
Yeah, I'm the taxman.
Should five percent appear too small.
Be thankful I don't take it all.
'Cause I'm the taxman,
Yeah, I'm the taxman.
If you drive a car
I'll tax the street.
If you try to sit
I'll tax you seat.
If you get too cold
I'll tax the heat.
If you take a walk
I'll tax your feet.
Taxman!
Don't ask me what I want it for,
If you don't want to pas some more
'Cause I'm the taxman,
Yeah, I'm the taxman.

Beware the pennies on your eye.
'Cause I'm the taxman,
Yeah, I'm the taxman.
And you're working for no one but me.

I will prove to you,
We will never be apart,
If I'm part of you.
Open your eyes now!

Tell Me Why
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Tell me why you cried,
And why you lied to me.
Tell me why you cried,
And why you lied to me.
Well, I gave you ev'rything I had,
But you left me sitting on my own,
Did you have to treat me oh, so bad?
All I do is hang my head and moan.
Tell me why you cried,
And why you lied to me.
Tell me why you cried,
And why you lied to me.
If it's something that I've said or done,
Tell me what and I'll apologize.

Holding back these tears in my eyes.
Tell me why you cried,
And why you lied to me.
Tell me why you cried,
And why you lied to me.

And why you lied to me.
Tell me why you cried,
And why you lied to me.

The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Hey, Bungalow Bill, what did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill, what did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun,
In case of accidents he always took his mom, he's the
All American bullet headed Saxon mother's son.
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill, what did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill, what did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies,
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So captain Marver zapped him right between the eyes.
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill, what did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill, what did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin,
"Not when he looked so fierce." his mother buttedin.
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him.
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill, what did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

The Fool On The Hill
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Day after day alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer.
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning 'round.
Well on the way, head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud,
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice.
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning 'round.
And nobody seems to like him,
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings.
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning 'round. 
- 268 -
He never listens to them,
He knows that they're the fools.
They don't like him.
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning 'round. 
- 269 -
The Inner Light
(G. Harrison)
Without going out of my door
I can know all things on earth.
Without looking out on my window
I could know the ways of heaven.
The farther one travels the less one knows, the less one knows.
Without going out of my door
You can know all things on earth.
Without looking out on my window
You could know the ways of heaven.
The farther one travels the less one knows, the less one knows.
Arrive without traveling,
See all without looking.

The Long And Winding Road
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear I've seen that road before,
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door.
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way.
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know
The many ways I've tried but
Still they lead me back to the long winding road
You left me standing here a long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door. 
- 271 -
The Night Before
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
We said our goodbyes,
Love was in your eyes,
Now today I find
You have changed you mind
Treat me like you did the night before.
Were you telling lies?
Was I so unwise?
When I held you near
You were so sincere,
Treat me like you did the night before.
Last night is the night
I will remember you by
When I think of things we did
It makes me wanna cry.

Like the night before.

The Word
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Say the word and you'll be free,
Say the word and be like me.
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, it's sunshine,
It's the word love.
In the beginning I misunderstood,
But now I've got it, the word is good;
Say the word and you'll be free,
Say the word and be like me.
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, it's sunshine,

It's so fine, it's sunshine,

Now that I know what I feel must be right.
I mean to show ev'rybody the light.

That the word is just the way.

And the only word is love
It's so fine, it's sunshine,
It's the word love.
Say the word, love.

There's A Place
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
There there's a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue;
And it's my mind
And there's no time
When I'm alone.
I I think of you
And things you do
Go round my head
The things you're said
Like I love only you.
In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so.
There oh there a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue;
And it's my mind
And there's no time 
- 276 -
When I'm alone.
There's a place,
There's a place.

Things We Said Today
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
You say you will love me
If I have to go.
You'll be thinking of me,
Somehow I will know.
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away,
Then I will remember
Things we said today.
You say you'll be mine girl
'Til the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find.
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love not a lot to say,
Then we will remember
Things we said today.
Me, I'm just the lucky kind,
Love to hear you say that love is love.
And though we may be blind
Love is here to stay
And that's enough
To make you mine girl,
Be the only one.

Think For Yourself
(G. Harrison)
I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do.
You've telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have if we close our eyes.
Do what you want to do,
And go where you're going to.
Think for yourself 'cause I won't be there with you.
I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind.
And though you still can't see,
I know your mind's made up, you're gonna cause more misery.
Do what you want to do,
And go where you're going to.
Think for yourself 'cause I won't be there with you.
Although your mind's opaque,
Try thinking more if just for your own sake.
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify all the things that you should.
Do what you want to do,
And go where you're going to. 
- 280 -
Think for yourself 'cause I won't be there with you.
Do what you want to do,
And go where you're going to.

This Boy
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
That boy took my love away.
Oh, he'll regret it some day,
But this boy wants you back again.
That boy isn't good for you.
Though he may want you too,
This boy wants you back again.
Oh, and this boy would be happy just to love you,
But oh my-yi-yi-yi, that boy won't be happy
Till he's seen you cry hi-hi-hi.
This boy wouldn't mind the pain,
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again.
This boy, this boy. 
- 282 -
Ticket To Ride
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
I think I'm gonna be sad. I think it's today, yeah!
Girl that's driving me mad is going away.
She's got a ticket to ride,
She's got a ticket to ri-hi-hide,
She's got a ticket to ride,
But she don't care.
She said that living with me is bringing her down, yeah!
She would never be free when I was around.
She's got a ticket to ride,
She's got a ticket to ri-hi-hide,
She's got a ticket to ride,
But she don't care.
I care, my baby don't know why she's riding so high.
She ought to think right,
She ought to do right by me.
Before she gets to staying goodbye.
She ought to think right,
She ought to do right by me.
I think I'm gonna be sad. I think it's today, yeah!
Girl that's driving me mad is going away.

Tip Of My Tongue
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
When I want to speak to you
If sometimes takes a week or two
To think of things I want to say to you.
But words just stay on the tip of my tongue.
When the skies are not so blue
There's nothing left for me to do
Just think of something how to say to you.
But words just stay on the tip of my tongue.
People say I'm lonely,
Only you know that's not true.
You know I'm waiting for a chance to prove my love to you.
Soon enough my time will come,
And after all is said and done
I'll marry you and we will live as one.
With no more words on the tip of my tongue, no more,
No words on the tip of my tongue. 
- 285 -
Tomorrow Never Knows
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Turn off your mind, relax, and float down stream,
It is not dying, it is not dying.
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void,
It is shining, it is shining.
Yet you may see the meaning of within,
It is being, it is being.
Love is all and love is ev'ryone,
It is knowing, it is knowing.
And ignorance and hate mourn the dead,
It is believing, it is believing.
But listen to the color of your dreams,
It is not leaving, it is not leaving.
So play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning,
Of the beginning, of the beginning. 
- 286 -
Two Of Us
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Two of us riding nowhere,
Spending someone's hard earned pay.
You and me sunday driving,
Not ariving on our way back home,
We're on our way home,
We're on our way home,
We're going home.
Two of us sending postcards,
Writing letters on my wall.
You and me burning matches,
Lifting latches on our way back home,
We're on our way home,
We're on our way home,
We're going home.
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead.
Two of us wearing raincoasts,
Standing solo in the sun.
You and me chasing paper,
Getting nowhere on our way back home.
We're on our way home,
We're on our way home, 
- 287 -
We're going home.
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead.

We're on our way home,
We're going home.

Wait
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home.
I've been away now, oh, how, I've been alone.
Wait till I come back to your side,
We forget the tears we cried;
But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away.
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay.
Wait till I come back to your side,
We forget the tears we cried;
I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be.
And if you do I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me.
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home.
I've been away now, oh, how, I've been alone.

We Can Work It Out
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Try to see it my way,
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way,
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone.
We can work it out,
We can work it out.
Think of what you're saying,
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright.
Think of what I'm saying,
We can work it out and get it straight or say goodnight.
We can work it out,
We can work it out.
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend.
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again.
Try to see it my way,
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong.
While you see it your way,
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long. 
- 291 -
We can work it out,
We can work it out.
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend.
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again.

What Goes On?
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney, R. Starkey)
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind.
What goes on in your mind?
The other day I sawed as I walked along the road,
But when I saw him with you I could feel my future fold.
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why.
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind.
What goes on in your mind?
I met you in the morning, waiting for the tides of time,
But now the tide is turn me I can see that I was blind.
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why.
What goes on in your heart?
I used to think of nobody else but you were just the same, 
- 293 -
You didn't even think of me as someone with a name.
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die.
Tell me why.
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind.
What goes on in your mind? 
- 294 -
What You're Doing
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Look what you're doing, I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you what you're doing to me?
You got me running and there's no fun in it
Why should it be too much to ask of you what you're doing to
me?
I've been waiting here for you, wond'ring what you're gonna
do.
Should you need a love that's true, it's me.
Please stop your lying, you got me crying girl
Why should it be too much to ask of you what you're doing to
me?
I've been waiting here for you, wond'ring what you're gonna
do.
Should you need a love that's true, it's me.
Please stop your lying, you got me crying girl

me?
What you're doing to me?
What you're doing to me?

When I'm Sixty Four
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now,
Will you still be sending me a valentine,
Birthday greeting, bottle of wine.
If I'd been out till quarter to three,
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty four?
You'll be older too,
Ah, and if you say the word,
I could stay with you.
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone.
You can knit a sweater by the fire side,
Sunday mornings, go for a ride.
Doing the garden, digging the weeds,
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty four?
Ev'ry summer we can rent a cottage on the Isle of Wight
If it's not too dear.
We shall scrimp and save. 
- 298 -
Ah, grandchildren on your knee,
Vera, Chuck and Dave.
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view.
Indicate precisely what you mean to say,
You're sincerely wasting away.
Give me your answer, fill in a form,
Mine forever more,
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty four?

While My Guitar Gently Weeps
(G. Harrison)
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps.
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps.
I don't know why nobody told you
Now to untold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you.
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps.
I with every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps.
I don't know how you were diverted you were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted no one alerted you.
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps.
I look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps.

With A Little Help From My Friends
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
What would you think if I sang out of tune,
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key,
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends,
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends,
Mm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.
What do I do when my love is away,
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day,
Are you sad because you're on your own?
No, I get by with a little help from my friends,
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends,
Mm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love.
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love.
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time. 
- 301 -
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you but I know it's mine.

Within You Without You
(G. Harrison)
We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion,
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass
away.
We were talking about the love we all could share,
When we find it to try our best to hold it there
With our love, with our love we could save the world.
Try to realize it's all within yourself no one else can make you
change.
And to see you're really only very small and life flows on
within you and without you.
We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see. Are you one of them? 
- 303 -
World Without Love
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Please lock me away and don't allow the day here inside
Where I hide with my loneliness.
I don't care what they say,
I won't stay in a word without love.
Birds sing out of tune and rain drops hide the moon. I'm O.K.
Here I'll say with my loneliness.
I don't care what they say,
I won't stay in a word without love.
So I wait and in a smile I will see my true love smile.
She may come, I know not when, when she does I'll know,
So baby until then, lock me away and don't allow the day here
inside
Where I hide with my loneliness.
I don't care what they say,
I won't stay in a word without love.

Yellow Submarine
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea,
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines,
So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
And our friends are all on board;
Many more of them live next door;
And the band begins to play.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
As we live a life of ease,
Ev'ryone of us has all we need. 
- 305 -
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

Yer Blues
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Yes, I'm lonely. Wanna die.
Yes, I'm lonely. Wanna die.
If I ain't dead already.
Girl, you know the reason why.
In the morning wanna die.
In the evening wanna die.
Girl, you know the reason why.
My mother was of the sky.
My father was of the earth.
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth.
Yes, I'm lonely. Wanna die.
Yes, I'm lonely. Wanna die.
If I ain't dead already.
Girl, you know the reason why.
The eagle picks my eye
The worm, he licks my bone.
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mister Jones.
Yes, I'm lonely. Wanna die.
Yes, I'm lonely. Wanna die. 
- 307 -
If I ain't dead already.
Girl, you know the reason why.
The black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist 'round my soul.
I feel so suicidal,
Even hate my rock and roll.
Yes, I'm lonely. Wanna die.
Yes, I'm lonely. Wanna die.
If I ain't dead already.
Girl, you know the reason why.

Yes It Is
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
If you wear me tonight,
Remember what I said tonight,
For red is the color that my baby wore
And what's more it's true, yes it is.
Scarlet were the clothes she wore,
Ev'rybody know's I'm sure.
I would remember all the things we planned
Understand it's true, yes it is, it's true, yes it is.
I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride.
Yes it is, yes it is, oh, yes it is, yeah.
Please don't wear red tonight,
This is what I said tonight,
For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you it's true, yes it is, it's true, yes it is, it's true.

Yesterday
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away.
Now it look as though they're here to stay,
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be.
There's a shadow hanging over me,
Oh, yesterday, came suddenly.
Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play,
Now I need a place to hide away,
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play,
Now I need a place to hide away,
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

You Can't Do That
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
I got something to say that might cause you pain;
If I catch you talking to that boy again,
I'm gonna let you down and leave you flat,
Because I told you before,
Oh, you can't do that.
Well, it's the second time I've caught you talking to him.
Do I have to tell you one more time I think it's a sin?
I think I'll let you down and leave you flat,
Because I've told you before,
Oh, you can't do that.
Ev'rybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if it's seen
You're talking that way, they'd laugh in my face.
So, please listen to me if you wanna stay mine.
I can't help my feeling, I'll go out of my mind.
I know I'll let you down and leave you flat,
Because I've told you before,
Oh, you can't do that.

You Like Me Too Much
(G. Harrison)
Though you're gone away this morning, you'll be back again
tonight,
Telling me there's be no next time if I just don't treat you
right.
You'll never leave me and you know it's true,
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.
You've tried before to leave me but you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely which is all that I desrve.
You'll never leave me and you know it's true,
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.
I really do,
And it's nice when you believe me,
If you leave me,
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it. I admit that I was wrong,
I wouldn't let you lee me 'cause it's true,
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.
'Cause you like me too much and I like you.

You Never Give Me Your Money
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
You never give me your money,
You only give me your funny paper,
And in the middle of negotiations, you break down.
I never give you my number,
I only give you my situation.
And in the middle of investigations, I break down.
Out of college, money spent,
See no future, pay no rent,
All the money's gone, nowhere to go.
Any jobber got the sack,
Monday morning turning back,
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go.
But, oh, that magic feeling nowhere to go,
Oh, that magic feeling nowhere to go,
Nowhere to go.
One sweet dream, pick up the bags, and get in the limousine.
Soon, we'll be away from here, step on the gas and wipe that
tear away.
One sweet dream came true today,
Came true today,
Came true today.

But I love you
See that I'm always
Thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh,
You treat me badly

You Won't See Me
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
When I call you up, your line's engaged.
I have had enough, so get your age.
We have lost the time that was so hard to find,
And I will lose my mind if you won't see me,
You won't see me.
I don't know why you should want to hide.
But I can't get through, my hands are tied.
I don't want to stay, I don't have much to say,
But I can turn away and you won't see me,
You won't see me.
Time after time you refuse to even listen.
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missin'.
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears.
And since I lost you it feels like years.
Yes it seems so long girl since you've been gone,
And I just can't go on if you won't see me,
You won't see me.
Time after time you refuse to even listen.

Your Mother Should Know
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born.
Though she was born a long long time ago,
Your mother should know,
Your mother should know.
Sing it again.

You've Got To Hide Your Love Away
(J. Lennon, P. McCartney)
Here I stand with head in hand,
Turn my face to the wall.
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two feet small.
Ev'rywhere people stare
Each and ev'ry day.
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say,
"Hey, you've got to hide your love away!
Hey, you've got to hide your love away!"
How can I ever try?
I can never win,
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in.
How could she say to me,
"Love will find away?"
Gather 'round all you clowns
Let me hear you say,
"Hey, you've got to hide your love away!
Hey, you've got to hide your love away!"
