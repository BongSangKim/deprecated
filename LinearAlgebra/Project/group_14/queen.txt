I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way 
How I had to keep on trying little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started - bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Well they say your folks are telling you to be a super star
But I tell you just be satisfied to stay right where you are
Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money
Honey you'll survive
Well I've loved a million women in a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything
I need to feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal 
I was told a million times of all the people in my way 
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles 
Then I'd still be where I started
Still be where I started 
Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money, honey
Honey you'll survive
Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money to keep me satisfied
(Do you think you're better every day
No I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave )
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
It'll take your time and take your money
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive 
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money to keep me satisfied
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and money
Honey you'll survive 
Keep you satisfied
Keep you satisfied

Yesterday my life was in ruin
Now today I know what I'm doing
Gotta feeling I should be doing all right
Doing all right
Where will I be this time tomorrow
Jump in joy or sinking in sorrow
Anyway I should be doing all right
Doing all right
Should be waiting for the sun
Looking round to find the words to say
Should be waiting for the skies to clear
There a time in all the world
Should be waiting for the sun
And anyway I've got hide away
Ah ah ah ah
Yesterday my life was in ruin
Now today God knows what I'm doing
Anyway I should be doing all right
Doing all right
Doing all right

Great King Rat died today
Born on the twenty first of May
Died syphilis forty four on his birthday
Every second word he swore
Yes he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?
Now hear this
Where will I be tomorrow? 
Will I beg ?, Will I borrow?
I don't care, I don't care anyway
Come on, come on the time is right
The man is evil and that is right
I told you ah yes I told you
And that's no lie, oh no no
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?
Show me
Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?
Hit it
Now listen all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're gonna be his disciple
Don't listen to what mama says
Not a word - not a word mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival
Sure, the great lord before he died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said you're going to realise tomorrow, oh woh oh woh oh woh
No I'm not going to tell you
What you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come on come on the time is right
This evil man will fight
I told you once before
Hear it
No
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Just like I said before
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
The last time I tell you
Would you like to see?

Aah, aah
In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever, ooh yeah
Lion's den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever
Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on on on on on on
My fairy king can see things
He rules the air and turns the tides
That are not there for you and me
Ooh yeah he guides the winds
My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong
Ah, then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land, aah, aah
They turn the milk into sour
Like the blue in the blood of my veins
Why can't you see it
Fire burning in hell with the cry of screaming pain
Son of heaven set me free and let me go
Sea turn dry, no salt from sand
Seasons fly no helping hand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor man's eyes, aah
Someone, someone has drained the colour from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the winds and wronged the tides
Mother Mercury Mercury
Look what they've done to me
I cannot run, I cannot hide
La la la la la la la la la la la la

I have sinned dear father, father I have sinned
Try and help me father

When I was young it came to me
And I could see the sun breakin'
Lucy was high and so was I dazzling
Holding the world inside
Once I believed in ev'ryone
Ev'ryone and anyone can see
Oh oh The Night Comes Down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh oh The Night Comes Down
Oooh and it's dark again
Once I could laugh with ev'ryone
Once I could see the good in me
The black and the white distinctively colouring
Holding the world inside
Now all the world is grey to me
Nobody can see you gotta believe it
Oh oh The Night Comes Down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh oh The Night Comes Down
Oooh and it's dark again
And it's dark again
And it's dark again

Had to make do with a worn out rock and roll scene
The old bop is gettin' tired need a rest
Well you know what I mean
Fifty eight that was great
But it's over now and That's all
Somethin' harder's coming up
Gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya grab you hard
Make you feel ten feet tall
Well I hope this baby's gonna come along soon
You don't know it could
happen any ol' rainy afternoon
With the temperature down
And the juke box blowin' no fuse
And my musical life's feelin
Like a long Sunday School cruise
And you know there's one thing
Every single body could use
Modern times rock and roll
Modern times rock and roll
Get you high heeled guitar boots and some groovy clothes
Get a hair piece on your chest
And a ring through your nose
Find a nice little man who says
He's gonna make you a big big star
Stars in your eyes and ants in your pants
Think you should go far
Everybody in this bum sucking world
Gonna know just who you are
Look out

I want you... woman
Tried to be a son and daughter rolled into one
You said you'd equal any man for having your fun
Now didn't you feel surprised to find
The cap just didn't fit?
The world expects a man
To buckle down and to shovel shit
What'll you do for loving
When it's only just begun?
I want you to be a woman
Tried to be a teacher and a fisher of men
An equal people preacher
Will you lead us all the same?
Well I traveled all around the world
A brand new word for day
Watching the time mustn't linger behind
Pardon me I have to get away
What'll you think of heaven
If it's back from where you came?
I want you to be a woman

And then i saw him in the crowd
a lot of people had gathered round him
the beggars shouted the lepers called him
the old man said nothing
he just stared about him
all going down to see the lord jesus
all going down to see the lord jesus
all going down
Then came a man before his feet he fell
unclean said the leper and rang his bell
felt the palm of a hand touch his head
go now go now you're a new man instead
all going down to see the lord jesus
all going down to see the lord jesus
all going down
It all began with the three wise men
followed a star took them to bethlehem
and made it heard throughout the land
born was a leader of man
all going down to see the lord jesus
all going down to see the lord jesus
all going down
It all began with the three wise men
followed a star took them to bethlehem
and made it heard throughout the land
born was a leader of man
all going down to see the lord jesus
all going down to see the lord jesus
all going down

Fear me you lords and lady preachers
I descend upon your earth from the skies
I command your very souls you unbelievers
Bring before me what is mine
The seven seas of rhye
Can you hear me you peers and privvy counsellors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
I swear that you'll be mine
The seven seas of rhye
Sister I live and lie for you
Mister do and I'll die
You are mine I possess you
I belong to you forever
Storm the master marathon I'll fly through
By flash and thunder fire I'll survive
Then I'll defy the laws of nature and come out alive
Then I'll get you
Be gone with you, you shod and shady senators
Give out the good, leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours
And with a smile
I'll take you to the seven seas of rhye
------------------------2Áý QueenII--------------------
A word in your ear, from father to son
Hear the word that I say
I fought with you, fought on your side
Long before you were born
Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son...
And the voice is so clear, time after time it keeps on
Calling you, calling you on
Don't destroy what you see, your country to be
Just keep building on the ground that's been won
Kings will be crowned, and the word goes around
From father to son, to son
Won't you hear us sing
(te de de de de de de de de de de de de de de)
Our family song
(te de de de de de de de de de de de de de de)
Father, father, father, father, ooh yeah, father, father, father, father
(te de de de de de de de de de de de de de de)
Now we hand it on
But I've heard it all before
Take this letter that I give you
Take it sonny, hold it high
You won't understand a word that's in it
But you'll write it out again before you die (yeah yeah)
A word in your ear from father to son
Funny you don't hear a single word I say
But my letter to you will stay by your side
Through the years till the loneliness is gone
Sing if you will - but the air you breathe I live to give you
Father to son, father to, father to, father to son
Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son...
Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
From father to son, to son
Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son...
Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
From father to son, to son
Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son...
Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
From father to son, to son
Joyful the sound, the word goes around

So sad her eyes
Smiling dark eyes
So sad her eyes
As it began
On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known
The White Queen walks and the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair
Needing - unheard
Pleading - one word
So sad my eyes
She cannot see
How did thee fare, what have thee seen
The mother of the willow green
I call her name
And 'neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came
White Queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no word would make
So still I wait
My Goddess, hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's for evermore that I wait
Dear friend goodbye
No tears in my eyes
So sad it ends
As it began
You never heard my song before
The music was too loud
But now I think you hear me well
For now we both know how
No star can light our way
In this cloud of dark and fear
But someday one day
Funny how the pages turn
And hold us in between
A misty castle waits for you
And you shall be a Queen
Today the cloud it hangs
Over us and all is grey
But someday one day
When I was you and you were me
And we were very young
Together took us nearly there
The rest may not be sung
So still the cloud it hangs
Over us and we're alone
But Some Day One Day
We'll come home

Mama's got a problem
She don't know what to say
Her little baby boy
Has just left home today
She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
She's Ma on whom you can always depend ooh
She washed and fed and clothed and cared
For nearly twenty years
And all she gets is Goodbye Ma
And the night times for her tears
She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
She's Ma on whom you can always depend ooh
So listen mothers everywhere
To just one mothers son
You'll get forgotten on the way
If you don't let them have their fun
Forget regrets and just remember
It's not so long since you were young
You're bound to be the loser in the end
You're bound to be the loser in the end
They'll chose their new shoes
That's not far to bend
You're Ma on whom they can always depend ooh ooh

Fa fa fa fa fa
Fa fa fa fa faa
Now once upon a time - an old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone - and the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies to find a new destination
That is the sign
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight
He gives a great big cry and he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies - the palm of a hand incredible size
One great big eye - has a focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight
Fa fa fa fa faa
Hoooa
The ogre-men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
You gotta keep down right out of sight
You can't see in, but they can see out
"Ooh keep a look out"
The ogre-men are coming out
From the two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind and they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go south
Aaargh
Aaaaaaaarghh
Ogre-men are going home
The great big fight is over
Bugle blow, let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives for ever more - oh oh oh
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle
Fa fa fa fa faa

He's a fairy feller
Ah ah the fairy folk have gathered
Round the new moon's shine
To see the feller crack a nut
At night's noon time
To swing his axe he swears
As he climbs he dares
To deliver the master stroke
Plow man wagoner will' and types
Politician with senatorial pipe
He's a dilly dally oh
Pedagogue squinting wears a frown
And a satyr peers under lady's gown
He's a dirty fellow
What a dirty laddie-oh
Tatterdemalion and the junketer
There's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter
He's my hero ah
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow (can we see the master stroke)
What a queer fellow
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Soldier sailor tinker tailor plow boy
Waiting to hear the sound
And the arch magician presides
He is the leader
Oberon and Titania watched by a harridan
Mab is the queen and there's a good apothecary man
Come to say hello
Fairy dandy tickling the fancy
Of his lady friend
The nymph in yellow
What a queer fellow
The ostler stares with hands on his knees
Come on mister feller
Crack it open of you please

There's no living in my life anymore
The seas have gone dry
And the rain's stopped falling
Please don't you cry any more
Can't you see
Listen to the breeze
Whisper to me please
Don't send me to the path of nevermore
Even the valley's below
Where the rays of the sun
Were so warm and tender
Now haven't anything to grow
Can't you see?
Why did you have to leave me? (nevermore)
Why did you deceive me? (nevermore)
You sent me to the path of nevermore
When you say you didn't love me anymore
Ah ah nevermore nevermore

Do you mean it do you mean it do you mean it
Why don't you mean it why do I follow you
And where do you go?
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
You've never seen nothing like it
No never in your life
Like going up to heaven
And then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it
Oooh give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing in a lily pool delight
Blue powder monkeys praying in the dead of night
Here comes the Black Queen poking in the pile
Fi fo the Black Queen marching single file
Take this take that bring them down to size
March to the Black Queen
Put them in the cellar with the naughty boys
Little nigger sugar then a rub-a-dub-a-baby oil
Black on black on every finger nail and toe
We've only begun - begun
Make this make that keep making all that noise
Ooh march to the Black Queen
Now I've got a belly full
You can be my sugar baby
You can be my honey chile
A voice from behind me reminds me
Spread out your wings you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
A little bit of love and joy
Everything you do bears a will
And a why and a wherefore
A little bit of love and joy
In each and every soul lies a man
And very soon he'll deceive and discover
But even to the end of his life
He'll bring a little love
Ah ah ah ah ah
I reign with my left hand I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness I'm queen of the night
I've got the power now to do
The march of the Black Queen
My life is in your hands I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy I'll be your bad boy
I'll do the march of the Black Queen
Ah ah ah ah ah
Walking true to style she's vulgar abuse and vile
The Black Queen tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes
And she never dots her I's
La la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la
Forget your sing a-longs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance to the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand in hand
But now it's time to be gone
La la la la forever forever
Ah ah ah ah ah

Funny how love is everywhere just look and see
Funny how love is anywhere you're bound to be
Funny how love is every song in every key
Funny how love is coming home in time for tea
Funny funny funny oh
Funny how love is the end of the lies
When the truth begins tomorrow comes
Tomorrow brings tomorrow brings love
In the shape of things
That's what love is that's what love is
Funny how love can break your heart so suddenly
Funny how love came tumbling down with Adam and Eve
Funny how love is running wild feeling free
Funny how love is coming home in time for tea
Funny funny funny oh
From the earth below to the heavens above
That's how far and funny is love
At any time anywhere
If you gotta make love do it everywhere
That's what love is that's what love is
Funny how love is everywhere just look and see
Funny how love is anywhere you're bound to be
Funny how love is every song in every key
Funny how love is when you gotta hurry
'Cause you're late for tea
Funny funny funny oh
Tomorrow comes tomorrow brings
Tomorrow brings love in the shape of things
At any time anywhere
If you gotta make love do it everywhere
That's what love is that's what love is

Happy little day, Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made, so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
"It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell"
"Jenny will you stay - tarry with me pray
Nothing 'ere need come between us tell me love, what do you say ?"
"Oh no I must away to my mum in disarray
If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air
I'll say farewell"
O rock of ages, do not crumble, love is breathing still
O lady moon, shine down a little people magic if you will
Jenny pines away, writes a letter everyday
"We must ever be together, nothing can my love erase"
"Oh no I'm compromised, I must apologise

And many a tear lives on in my eye
Down in the city just Hoople and me

Wo wo la la
Wah wah ooh
But that's not true

My new purple shoes
Bin amazin' the people next door
And my rock'n'roll forty fives
Bin enragin' the folks on the lower floor
I got a way with the girls on my block
Try my best to be a real individual
And when we go down to smokies and rock
They line up like it's some kind of ritual
Oh give me a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light outa this place
I like the good things in life
But most of the best things ain't free
It's the same situation just cuts like a knife
When you're young and you're poor and you're crazy
Young and you're crazy...
Oh give me a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light outa this place.

Dislocate your spine if you don't sign he says
I'll have you seeing double (double)
Mesmerize you when he's tongue-tied
Simply with those eyes, ooh ooh ooh
Synchronize your minds and see
The beast within him rise
Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been had
Intoxicate your brain with what I'm saying
If not you'll lie in knee-deep trouble
Prostitute yourself he says
Castrate your human pride, ooh ooh ooh
Sacrifice your leisure days
Let me squeeze you till you've dried
Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off, aah, aah, aah
Work my fingers to my bones
I scream with pain
I still make no impression
Seduce you with his money-make machine
Cross-collateralize, (big-time money money)
Reduce you to a muzak-fake machine
Then the last goodbye
It's a rip-off
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm, and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been had

I am forever searching high and low
but why does ev'ryone tell me no
neptune of the seas an answer for me please
the lily of the valley doesn't know
I lie in wait with open eyes
i carry on thru' stormy skies
i follow ev'ry course my kingdom for a horse
but each time i grow old
serpent of the nile relieve me for a while
and cast me from your spell and let me go
Messenger from seven seas has flown
to tell the king of rhye he's lost his throne
wars will never cease
is there time enough for peace?
the lily of the valley doesn't know

I love
She makes me
She is my heart
She is my love
She is my love
I know
I'm jealous of her
She makes me need
She is my love
She is my love
Who knows who she'll make me
As I lie in her cocoon
And the world will surely heal my ills
I'm warm and terrified
She makes me so
I know the day I leave her
I'll love her still
She is my love
She is my love
Who knows where my dreams will end
I'll follow as they grow
But the world will know how long I'll take
And if I'm very slow she makes me so
She is my love
She is my love

So dear friends your love is gone
Only tears to dwell upon
I dare not say as the wind must blow
So a love is lost, a love is won
Go to sleep and dream again
Soon your hopes will rise and then
From all this gloom life can start anew
And there'll be no crying soon

You suck my blood like a leech You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain till it hurts You've taken all my money - you still want more, 
Misguided old mule With your pigheaded rules
With your narrow - minded cronies who are fools of the first division-  
Death on two legs -
You're tearing me apart,
Death on two legs
You never had a heard of your own -
Kill joy, Bad guy,
Big talking, Small fry
You're just an old barrow - boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me,
Can you face me -
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye
Feel good, are you satisfied
Do you feel like suicide (I think you should)
Is your conscience all right
Does it plague you at night,
Do you feel good - Feel good!
Talk like a big business tycoon,
But you're just a hot - air balloon,
So no one gives you a damn,
You're just an overgrown school - boy
Let me tan your hide.
A dog with disease,
King of the 'sleaze'
Put your money where your mouth is Mr. Know all,
Was the fin on your back part of the deal...(shark!)
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs -
You never had a heart of your own,
(You never did, right from the start)
Insane you should be put inside,
You're a sewer - rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed
Then make yourself null - and - void,
Make me feel good
I feel good.

I go out to work on a Monday morning 
Tuesday I go off to honeymoon

Afternoon

The machine of a dream, such a clean machine,
With the pistons a pumpin', 
and the hubcaps all gleam.
When I'm holding your wheel,
All I hear is your gear,
When my hand's on your grease gun,
Oh it's like a disease son,
I'm in love with my car, gotta feel for my automobile,
Get a grip on my boy racer rollbar,
Such a thrill when your radials squeal.
Told my girl I just had to forget her,
Rather buy me a new cartburettor,
So she made tracks sayin' ths is the end now,
Cars don't talk back they're just four wheeled
friends now,
When I'm holding your wheel,
All I hear is your gear,
When I'm cruisin' in overdrive,
Don't have to listen to no run of the mill talk jive, 
I'm in love with my car, gotta feel for my automobile,
I'm in love with my car, string back gloves in 
my automolove!

Ooh you make me live
Whatever this world can give to me
It's you you're all I see
Ooh you make me live now honey
Ooh you make me live
Ooh you're the best friend that I ever had
I've been with you such a long time
You're my sunshine and I want you to know
That my feelings are true
I really love you
Oh you're my best friend
Ooh you make me live
Ooh I've been wandering round
But I still come back to you
In rain or shine
You've stood by me girl
I'm happy at home
You're my best friend
Ooh you make me live
Whenever this world is cruel to me
I got you to help me forgive
Ooh you make me live now honey
Ooh you make me live
You're the first one
When things turn out bad
You know I'll never be lonely
You're my only one
And I love the things
I really love the things that you do
Ooh you're my best friend
Ooh you make me live
I'm happy at home
You're my best friend
Oh you're my best friend
Ooh you make me live
You're my best friend

In the year of '39 assembled here the volunteers
In the days when the lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
The sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day
And the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew
In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The Volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the earth is old and grey, little darlin' we'll away
But my love this cannot be
For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
All your letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand
For my life
Still ahead
Pity me

You call me up and treat me like a dog
You call me up and tear me up inside
You've got me on a lead
You bring me down
You shout around
You don't believe that I'm alone.
Sweet Lady
Sweet Lady
Sweet Lady...Stay sweet.
You say
'You call me up and feed me all the lines
'You call me sweet lime I'm some kind of cheese
'Waiting on the shelf
'You eat me up
'You hold me down
'I'm just a fool to make you a home
'And you say
'Sweet lady
'Sweet lady
'Sweet lady...Stay sweet.'
My Sweet lady
Though it seems like we wait forever
Stay sweet baby
Believe and we've got everything we need.

Seaside  whenever you stroll along with 
me I'm merely contemplating what
you feel inside meanwhile I ask you to be 
my Clementine 
You say you'd have to tell your daddy if 
you can  I love you madly 
Let me imagination run away with you 
gladly 
A brand new angle highly commendable  
Seaside Rendezvous 
I feel so romantic  can we do it again
Can we do it again sometime,
Fantastic, c'est la vie mesdames et messieurs
And at the peak of the season, the
Mediterranean , this time of year, it's so 
fashionable,
I feel like dancing  in the tain,
All I need is a volunteer 
Dancing  what a damn jolly good idea 
It's such a jollification  as a matter of fact, so 
tres charmant my dear 
Underneath the moonlight  together we'll sail 
across the sea 
Reminiscing every night
Meantime  I ask you to be my valentine
You say you do if you did but you daren't I'll be 
your Valentino 
We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino
Get a new facial so sensational
Seaside Rendezvous so adorable,
Seaside Rendezvous 
Seaside Rendezvous 

Oh Oh people of earth
Listen to the warning
The seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man.
I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hands on the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare.
I watched as fear took the old man's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves
I see no day, I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal.
Oh Oh people of earth
Listen to the warning
The prophet he said
For soon the cold of night will fall
Summoned by your own hand.
Oh Oh children of the land
Quicken to the new life
Take my hand
Fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove.
He told of death as a bone white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved babe
Late too late all the wretches run
These kings of beasts now counting their days. 
From Mother's love is the son estranged
Married his own, his precious gain
The earth will shake, in two will break
And death all around will be your dowry
Oh Oh people of th earth
Listen to the warning the seer he said
For those who hear and mark my words
Listen to the good plan.
Oh Oh and two by two
My human zoo
They'll be running for to come
Running for to come out of the rain
Oh fear for your life,
Who heed me not
Let all your devils make you
Oh flee for your life,
Deceive you not
The fires of hell will take you
Should death await you.
God give you grace to purge this place
And peace all around will be your fortune
Oh Oh children of the land,
Love is still the answer take my hand
The vision fades, the voice I hear
Don't listen to the mad man
But still I fear and still I dare not
Laugh at the mad man

Love of my life,
You hurt me,
You broken my heart,
Now you leave me

Love of my life can't you see,
Bring it back bring it back,
Don't take it away from me,
Because you don't know what it means to me
Love of my life don't leave me,
You've stolen my love you now desert me,
Love of my life can't you see,
Bring it back bring it back,
Don't take it away from me,
Because you don't know what it means to me
You will remember when this is blown over,
And everything's all by the way,
When I grow older,
I will be there at your side,
To remind how I still love you
I still love you
I still love you
Back hurry back,
Please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know what it means to me
Love of my life,
Love of my life

Take good core of what you've got
My father said to me
As he puffed his pipe and Baby B.
He dandled on his knee
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away
Keep all Good Company
Oo Hoo Oo Hoo
Take care of those you call your own
And keep Good Company
Soon I grew and happy too
My very good friends and me
We'd play all day and Sally J.
The girl from number four
And very soon I begged her won't you
Keep me Company
Now marriage is an insinuation sure
My wife and I our needs and nothing more 
All my friends by a year
By and by disappear
But we're safe enough behind our door.
I flourished in my humble trade
My reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours
But when my time was through
Reward of all my efforts my own
Limited Company
I hardly noticed Sall as we
Pated Company
All through the years in the end it appears
There was never really anyone but me
Now I'm old I puff my pipe
But no-one's there to see
I ponder on the lesson of
My life's insanity
Take care of those you call your own
And Keep Good Company

Is this the real life 
Is this just fantasy 
Caught in a landslide 
No escape from reality 
Open your eyes 
Look up to the skies and see 
I¡¯m just a poor boy,I need no sympathy 
Because I¡¯m easy come, easy go, 
A little high, little low, 
Anyway the wind blows, doesn¡¯t really matter to me, 
Mama just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger now he`s dead
Mama life had just begun
But now I`ve gone and thrown it all away -
Mama wooo
Didn`t mean to make you cry -
If I`m not back again this time tomorrow -
Carry on carry on as if nothing really matters -
Too late my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body`s aching all the time
Goodbye everybody - I`ve got to go -
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth -
Mama wooo -
I don`t want to die
I sometimes wish I`d never been born at all -
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche scaramouche will you do the Fandango -
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me -
Galileo Galileo
Galileo Galileo
Galileo figaro - Magnifico -
But I`m just a poor boy and nobody loves me -
He`s just a poor boy from a poor family -
Spare him his life from this monstrosity -
Easy come easy go - will you let me go -
Bismillah! No - we will not let you go - let him go -
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let me go
Will not let you go - let me go
Will not let you go - let me go
No no no no no no no -
Mama mia mama mia mama mia let me go -
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me for me -
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye -
So you think you can love me and leave me to die -
Oh Baby - Can`t do this to me baby -
Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here -
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
nothing really matters to me

Look into my eyes and you'll see
I'm the only one
You've captured my love
Stolen my heart
Changed my life
Every time you make a move
You destroy my mind
And the way you touch
I lose control and shiver deep inside
You take my breath away
You can reduce me to tears
With a single sigh
Every breath that you take -
Any sound that you make
Is a whisper in my ear
I could give up all my life for just one kiss
I would surely die
If you dismiss me from your love
You take my breath away
So please don't go
Don't leave me here all by myself
I get ever so lonely from time to time
I will find you
Anywhere you go, I'll be right behind you
Right until the ends of the earth
I'll get no sleep till I find you to tell you
That you just take my breath
away
I will find you...etc
I'll get no sleep til I find you to
tell you when I've found you -
I love you

You might believe in heaven
I would not care to say
For every star in heaven
There's a sad soul here today
Wake up in the morning with a good face
Stare at the moon all day
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
Does anyone care anyway
For all the prayers in heaven
So much of life's this way
Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long long way behind us
Who knows when, now who knows where
Where the light of day will find us?
Look for the day
Take heart, my friend, we love you
Though it seems like you're alone
A million lights above you
Smile down upon your home
Hurry put your troubles in a suitcase
Come let the new child play
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
I'm leaving here, I'm long away
For all the stars in heaven
I would not live
I could not live this way
Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long way behind us
Leave it for some hopeless lane
Such a long long way
such a long long way
such a long long away
I'm looking for
Still looking for that day

Bring out the charge of the love brigade 
There is spring in the air once again 
Drink to the sound of the song parade 
There is music and love ev'rywhere 
Give a little love to me 
(I wanna) Take a little love from me 
I want to share it with you 
Feel like a millionaire 
Once we were mad we were happy 
We spent all our days holding hands together 
Do you remember my love 
How we danced and played? 
In the rain we laid 
We could stay there for ever and ever 
Now I am sad you are so far away 
I sit counting the hours day by day 
Come back to me 
How I long for your love 
Come back to me 
Be happy like we used to be 
Come back come back to me 
Come back come back to me 
Oh come back to me oh my love 
How I long for your love 
Won't you come back to me? 
Bring out the charge of the love brigade

Music is playing in the darkness
And a lantern goes swinging by
Shadows flickering my heart's jittering
Just you and I
Not tonight come tomorrow
When everything's sunny and bright (Sunny and bright)
No no no come tomorrow 'cause then
We'll be waiting in the moonlight
We'll go walking in the moonlight
Walking in the moonlight
Laughter ringing in the darkness
People drinking for days gone by
Time don't mean a thing
When you're by my side
Please stay awhile
You know I never could foresee the future years
You know I never could see
Where life was leading me
But will we be together forever
What will be my love
Can't you see that I just don't know
No not tonight not tomorrow
Everything's gonna be alright (Sunny and bright)
Wait and see if tomorrow we'll be
As happy as we're feeling tonight
We'll go walking in the moonlight (We'll be happy)
Walking in the moonlight
I can hear the music in the darkness
Floating softly to where we lie
No more questions now
Let's enjoy tonight
(Just you and I) 
Just you and I
Just you and I
Can't you see that we've gotta be together
Be together just you and I just you and I
No more questions just you and I

I just can't get no relief, Lord! Somebody,
somebody Somebody, somebody Can
anybody find me somebody to love? I
work hard every day of my life I

own I get down on my knees and start
to pray Till the tears run down
from my eyes Lord-somebody-somebody Please

love? He works hard Everyday-I

I'm a simple man with a simple name
From this soil my people came
In this soil remain oh yeah oh yeah
We made us our shoes
And we trod soft on the land
But the immigrant built roads
On our blood and sand oh yeah
White man White man
Don't you see the light behind your blackened skies
White man White man
You took away the sight to blind my simple eyes
White man White man
Where you gonna hide from the hell you've made
Oh the red man knows wars
With his hands and his knives
On the Bible you swore
Fought your battle with lies oh yeah
Leave my body in shame
Leave my soul in disgrace
But by ev'ry god's name
Say a prayer for your race oh yeah
White man White man
Our country was green and all our rivers wide
White man White man
You came with a gun and soon our children died
White man White man
Don't you give a light for the blood you've shed?
White man White man
White man
White man White man
For you battled with lies
White man White man
Still lies
White man White man
Say you look around every skin and bone again
What is left of your dream?
Just the words on your stone
A man who learned how to teach
Then forgot how to learn
Oh yeah

I can dim the lights &sing you songs full of sad things
We can do the tango just for two
I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings
Be a Valentino just for you
Ooh love ooh loverboy
What`re you doing tonight,
hey boy Set my alarm, turn on my charm That`s because
I`m a good old fashioned loverboy
Ooh let me feel your heartbeat
(grow faster,faster)Ooh ooh can you feel my love heat
Come on and sit on my hot seat of love & tell me how
do you feel right after all I`d like for you and I
to go romancing Say the word,
your wish is my command
Ooh love, ooh loverboy What`re you doing tonight,
hey boy Write my letter, feel much better
I`ll use my fancy patter on the telephone
When I`m not with you I think of you always
I miss you (I miss those long hot summer nights)
When I`m not with you, think of me always I love you
love you Hey boy, where`d you get it from
Hey boy where did you go I learned my passion
in the good old fashioned school of loverboys
instrumental break
Dining at the Ritz we`ll meet at nine precisely
I will pay the bill you taste the wine
Driving back in style in my saloon will do quite nicely
Just take me back toyours that will be fine
(come on and get it) Ooh love, ooh loverboy
What`re you doing tonight, hey boy
Everything`s all right, just hold on tight
That`s because I`m a good old fashioned loverboy

It's the sad eyed, goodbye, yesterday
moments I remember It's the bleak
street, weak kneed partings I recall It's
the mistier mist, the hazier days,
the brighter sun, and the easier
lays There's all the more reason
for laughing and crying When you're
younger and life isn't too hard at
all It's the fantastic drowse
of the afternoon Sundays That bored
you to rages of tears The unending
pleadings, to waste all your good
times In thoughts of your middle
aged years It's a vertical hold,
all the things that you're told For
the everyday hero it all turns to
zero And there's all the more reason
for living or dying When you're
young and your troubles are all very
small Out here on the street,
we'd gather up and meet And scuff
up the sidewalk with endlessly restless
feet Half of the time, we'd broaden
our minds More in the poolhall than
we did in the schoolhall With the
downtown chewing-gum bums Watching
the nightlife, the lights and the
fun Never wanted to be the boy
next door Always thought I'd be
something more But it ain't easy
for a small town boy It ain't easy
at all Thinkin' it right, doing
it wrong It's easier from an armchair Waves
of alternatives wash at my sleepness Have
my eggs poached for breakfast I guess... I'd
like to be Clint Eastwood Jimi Hendrix,
he was great let's try William The
Conqueror Now who else do I like? 

When I'm gone, no need to wonder if I ever think of you 
The same moon shines, the same wind blows for both of us 
And time is but a paper moon... be not gone 
Though I'm gone, it's as though I hold the flower that touches you 
A new life grows, The blossom knows 
There's no-one else could warm my heart as much as you... be not gone 
Let us cling together as the years go by 
Oh my love, my love 
In the quiet of the night, let our candle always burn 
Let us never lose the lessons we have learned 
Teo toriatte konomama iko, Aisuruhito yo 
Shizukana yoi ni, Hikario tomoshi 
Itoshiki oshieo idaki 
Hear my song still think of me, the way you've come to think of me 
The nights grow long, but dreams live on 
Just close your pretty eyes, and you can be with me 
Dream on... 
Teo toriatte konomama iko, Aisuruhito yo 
Shizukana yoi ni, Hikario tomoshi 
Itoshiki oshieo idaki 
When I'm gone, they'll say we were all fools 
And we don't understand 
Oh be strong don't turn your heart 
We're all, you're all, we're all for all, for always 
Let us cling together as the years go by 
Oh my love my love 
In the quiet of the night, let our candle always burn 
Let us never lose the lessons we have learned

I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes 
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the world
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions of the world
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions

Well you're just 17 and all you want to do is disappear

She came without a farthing
A babe without a name
So much ado 'bout nothing
Is what she'd try to say
So much ado my lover
So many games we played
Through every fleeted summer
Through every precious day
All dead, all dead
All the dreams we had
And I wonder why I still live on
All dead, all dead
And alone I'm spared
My sweeter half instead
All dead
And gone
All dead...
All dead, all dead
At the rainbow's end
And still I hear her own sweet song
All dead, all dead
Take me back again
You know my little friend's
All dead
And gone
Her ways are always with me
I wander all the while
But please you must forgive me
I am old but still a child
All dead, all dead
But I should not grieve
In time it comes to everyone
All dead, all dead
But in hope I breathe
Of course I don't believe
You're dead
And gone
All dead
And gone.

Hey you boy, hey you
Hey you boy, think that you know what you're doing
You think you're gonna set things to rights
You're just another picture on a teenage wall
You're just another sucker ready for a fall
You gotta fight from the inside
Attack from the rear
Fight from the inside
You can't win with your hands tied
Fight from the inside
Ooh, ooh, aah
Fight from the inside
Right down the line
Hey you boy, hey you
Hey you boy, think that you know what you're doing
You think that out in the streets is all true
You're just another, money-spinner tool
You're just another, fool
You gotta fight from the inside
Attack from the rear
Fight from the inside
You can't win with your hands tied
Fight from the inside
Ooh, ooh, aah
Fight from the inside
Right down the line
Right down the line
Right down the line

I was nothin' but a city boy
My trumpet was my only toy
I've been blowin' my horn
Since I knew I was born
But there ain't nobody wants to know
I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't want to go home
So round the corner comes a limousine
And the biggest grin I ever seen
Here sonny won't you sign
Right along the dotted line
What you sayin' are you playin'
Sure you don't mean me?
I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't want to go home
They took me to a room without a table
They said 'blow your trumpet into here'
I played around as well as I was able
And soon we had the record of the year
I was a legend all through the land
I was blowin' to a million fans
Nothin' was a missin'
All the people want to listen
You'd have thought I was a happy man
And I was sleepin' like a princess
Never touch the road
I don't get hungry
And I sure don't want to go home
(Have to have some fun...)
Now they tell me that I ain't so fashionable
An' I owe the man a million bucks a year
So I told 'em where to stick the fancy label
It's just me and the road from here
I'm back to playin' and layin'
I'm back on the game
I'm sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I sure get hungry and
I sure do want to go home

 make it half past six you come at seven
Always trying to keep me, hanging round
You little spoilt thing, girl you kept me waiting
Never contemplating my point of view
This comes as no surprise
I'm a fool, for I believed your lies
But now I've seen through your disguise
Who needs, well I don't need, who needs you?
Oh I believed you
Went on my knees to you
How I trusted you
But you turned me down
But it's dog eat dog in this rat race
And it leaves you bleeding lying flat on your face
Reaching out, reaching out for a helping hand
Where is that helping hand?
How I was pushed around
"Don't let it get you down"
You walked all over me
"But don't you ever give in"
Taking one step forward, slipping two steps back
There's an empty feeling that you can't forget
Reaching out, reaching out for a helping hand
When I met you, you were always charming
Couldn't sleep at night 'till you were mine
You were oh so so sophisticated
Never interested in what I'd say
I had to swallow my pride
So naive, you took me for a ride
But now I'm the one to decide
Who needs, well I don't need, who needs you?

You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you in the candle light
There's no-one but myself to blame
But there's something inside
That's turning my mind away
Woh - how I could love you
If I could let you stay
It's late - and I'm bleeding deep inside
It's late - ooh, is it just my sickly pride?
Too late - even now the feeling seems to steal away
So late - though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say
It's late - It's late - It's late
But not too late
Mmm, yeah
The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time
The more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down, yes
Now you tell me you're leaving
And I just can't believe it's true
Oh, you know that I can love you
Though I know I can't be true
Oh, you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through
It's late - mmm, and it's driving me so mad
It's late - yes I know, but don't try and tell me that it's
Too late - save our love you can't turn out the light
So late - I've been wrong but I'll learn to be right
It's late - It's late - It's late
But not too late
Mm, I've been so long
You've been so long
We've been so long tryin' to work it out
I ain't got long
You ain't got long
We've gotta know what this life's all about, ooh
Tell me
Tryin' to work it out, yeah, ooh
Ooh too late, yeah, too late, much too late, aaah
You're staring at me
With suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?
I know that I can't reply
If I take you tonight
Is it making my life a lie?
Oh you make me wonder
Did I live my life right?
It's late - ooh, but it's time to set me free
It's late - ooh, yes I know, but there's no way it has to be
Too late - so let the fire take our bodies this night
So late - let the waters take our guilt in the tide
It's late - It's late - It's late - It's late
It's late - It's late - It's late
Oh, It's all too late
Woah, woah, c'mon
Ooh m m m m late too late oh yeah
Waaa

Another party is over
And I'm left cold sober
Baby left me for somebody new
I don't wanna talk about it
Want to forget about it
Wanna be intoxicated with that special brew
So come and get me
Let me
Get in that sinking feeling
That says my heart is on an all time low, so
Don't expect me
To behave perfectly
And wear that sunny smile
My guess is I'm in for a cloudy and overcast
Don't try and stop me
'Cause I'm heading for that stormy weather soon
I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm permanently glued
To this extraordinary mood, so now move over
And let me take over
With my melancholy blues
I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm in the news
I'm just getting used to my new exposure
Come into my enclosure
And meet my melancholy blues

Oh how wrong can you be?
Oh to fall in love was my very first mistake
How was I to know I was far too much in love to see?
Oh jealousy look at me now
Jealousy you got me somehow
You gave me no warning
Took me by surprise
Jealousy you led me on
You couldn't lose you couldn't fail
You had suspicion on my trail
How how how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy
Oh how strong can you be
With matters of the heart?
Life is much too short
To while away with tears
If only you could see just what you do to me
Oh jealousy you tripped me up
Jealousy you brought me down
You bring me sorrow you cause me pain
Jealousy when will you let go?
Gotta hold of my possessive mind
Turned me into a jealous kind
How how how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy
But now it matters not if I should live or die
'Cause I'm only left with my own jealousy

Monday the start of my holiday
Freedom for just one week
Feels good to get away ooh
Tuesday I saw her down on the beach
I stood and watched a while
And she looked and smiled at me
Wednesday I didn't see her
I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow
And then on Thursday
My luck had changed
She stood there all alone
I went and asked her name
I never thought that this could happen to me
In only seven days
It would take a hundred or more
For memories to fade
I wish Friday would last for ever
I held her close to me
I couldn't bear to leave her there
Saturday just twenty four hours
Oh no I'm going back home on Sunday
Ooh so sad alone
Oh I used to be your baby
Used to be your pride and joy
Mmm, You used to take me dancing
Just like any other boy
But now you've found another partner
And left me like a broken toy
Oh it's someone else you're taking
Someone else you're playin' to
Honey though I'm aching
Know just what I have to do
If I can't have you when I'm wakin'
I'll go to sleep and dream I'm with you
Oh take me take me take me
To the dreamer's ball
Mmm, I'll be right on time and I'll dress so fine
You're gonna love me when you see me
I won't have to worry
Take me take me
Promise not to wake me till it's morning
It's all been true
What do you say about that then honey ?
Are you gonna take me to that dreamer's ball ?
I'd like that
Right on that forty second street
Way down down town we must go
Oh take me take me take me
I'm your plaything now
You make my life worthwhile with the slightest smile
Or destroy me with a barely perceptible whisper
Gently take me remember I'll be dreamin' of my baby
At the dreamer's ball
Oh, take me hold me
Remember what you told me
You'd meet me at the dreamer's ball
I'll meet you at the dreamer's ball
Ooh

And I breath the air
And I slam the door
And I'm on my way
I won't lay no blame
I won't call you names
'Cause I've made my break
And I won't look back
I've turned my back
On those endless games
I'm all through with ties
I'm all tired of tears
I'm a happy man
Don't it look that way
Shakin' dust from my shoes
There's a road ahead
And there's no way back home (no way back home)
Oh but I have to say
Leavin' home ain't easy
Oh I never thought it would be easy
Leavin' on your own
Oh is the main thing calling me back
Leavin' home ain't easy
On the one you're leavin' home
Stay my love my love please stay
Stray my love what's wrong my love?
What's right my love?
Oh leavin' home ain't easy
I thought how could I think of leavin'
Leavin' on your own
Still tryin' to persuade me that
Leavin' home ain't necessarily the only way
Leavin' home ain't easy
But may be the only way

Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive and the world I'll turn it inside out, yeah
And floating around in ecstasy
So don't stop me now don't stop me

A thousand times before

With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet,
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready, hey, are you ready for this? 
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat? 
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you when you're gone? 
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied? 
How long can you stand the heat? 
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too

There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him
You can treat him bad and leave him when he's down
But I'm ready, yes, I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat oh yeah
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust
Oh shooter hey hey, all right

No I'll never look back in anger
No I'll never find me an answer
You promised me you'd keep in touch
I read your letter and it hurt me so much
I said I'd never never be angry with you
I don't want to feel like a stranger no
'Cause I'd rather stay out of danger
I read your letter so many times
I got your meaning between the lines
I said I'd never never be angry with you
I must be strong so she won't know how much I miss her
I only hope as time goes on I'll forget her
My bodies aching can't sleep at night
I'm to exhausted to start a fight
And if I see her with another guy
I'll eat my heart out 'cause I love her
Love her love her love her
Come on baby let's get together
I'll love you baby I'll love you forever
I'm trying hard to stay away
What made you change
What did I say
Ooh I need your loving tonight
Ooh I need your loving 
Ooh I need your loving 
Ooh I need your loving babe tonight
Hit me
Ooh I need your loving tonight
No I'll never look back in anger
No I'll never find me an answer
Can't be no warning how could I guess
I'll have to learn to forgive and forget
Ooh I need your loving
Ooh I need your loving
Ooh I need your loving tonight

She knows how to rock 'n' roll

Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready

Hey little babe you're changing
Babe are you feeling sore?
It ain't no use in pretending
You don't wanna play no more
It's plain that you ain't no baby
What would your mother say?
You're all dressed up like a lady
How come you behave this way?
Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
To love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
Sail away sweet sister
I'll always be in love with you
Forgive me for what I told you
My heart makes a fool of me
You know that I'll never hold you
I know that you gotta be free
Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
To love you half as much as me
Take it the way you want it
But when they let you down my friend
Sail away sweet sister
Back to my arms again
Hot child don't you know you're young
You got your whole life ahead of you?
And you can throw it away too soon
Way too soon
Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody's
Gonna love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
Sail away sweet sister
I'll always be in love with you

It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you
How I cried
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham it seems
The years belie we lived a lie
I love you till I die
Save me save me save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me save me save me
I'm naked and I'm far from home
The slate will soon be clean
I'll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted
All that love?
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart I'm cold inside
I have no real intent
Save me save me save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me save me save me
Oh I'm naked and I'm far from home
Each night I cry I still believe the lie
I love you 'till I die
Save me save me save me
Save me save me oh save me
Don't let me face my life alone
Save me save me oh
I'm naked and I'm far from home

This street honey is a mean street
Living in this street honey needs a mean streak
We've got criminals living in this street
But there's a heart beat pulse
That keeps on pumping
Like a juke box playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I got a feeling this world is using me
This town honey is a dead town
Living in this town honey is a let down
Coming to this town honey is a show down
But there's a heart beat pulse
That keeps on pumping some sunshine ray
Through a crack in the shutter
Or a sight of a light at the end of a tunnel
Still there's a feeling this world is using me
Action this day action this night
Oh we've gotta learn to love to live
You can't say it ain't right
Action this day action this night
Oh you've got the power you've got the power
You've got the power to love to live
You can't say it ain't right
Your mind honey is a bleak place
Living in your minds living in a blank space
Your mind is coming from a rat race
But there's a heart beat pulse
That keeps on pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I got a feeling that just won't quit
This world is using me
Action this day action this night
Oh we've gotta learn to love to live
We can't say it ain't right
Action this day action this night
Oh you've got the power you've got the power
You've got the power to love to live
You can't say it ain't right
Action action this day
Action this day
Action action this day
Action this day
Living in the street

They called him a hero
In the land of the free
But he wouldn't shake my hand boy
He disappointed me
So I got my hand gun
And I blew him away
That critter was a bad guy
And I had to make him pay
You might fear for my reason
I don't care what they say
Look out baby it's the season
For the mad masquerade
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire
Oh you need a bullet like a hole in the head
Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire
Don't believe what your grand-daddy said
She was my lover
It was a shame that she died
But the constitution's right on my side
'Cause I caught my lover in the neighbour's bed
I got retribution
Filled 'em all full of lead
I've been told it's the fashion
To let me on the streets again
It's nothing but a crime of passion
And I'm not to blame
Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire
You need a weapon like a hole in the head
Put out the fire, put out the fire, baby put out the fire
And let your sons and daughters sleep sound in their beds
You know a gun never killed nobody
You can ask anyone
People get shot by people
People with guns
Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire
You need a gun like a hole in the head
Put out the fire, put out the fire, put out the fire
Just tell me that old fashioned gun law is dead
Shoot, shoot...

Guilt stains on my pillow
Blood on my terraces
Torsos in my closet
Shadows from my past
Life is real, life is real
Life is real, so real
Sleeping is my leisure
Waking up in a minefield
Dream in just a pleasure dome
Love is a roulette wheel
Life is real, life is real
Life is real, oh yeah
Success is my breathing space
I brought it on myself
I will price it, I will cash it
I can take it or leave it
Loneliness is my hiding place
Breast feeding myself
What more can I say?
I have swallowed the bitter pill
I can taste it I can taste it
Life is real, life is real
Life is real
Music will be my mistress
Loving like a whore
Lennon is a genius
Living in ev'ry pore
Life is real, life is real
Life is real, so real
Life is cruel, life is a bitch
Life is real, so real
Life is real, life is real, yeah
Life is real.

Calling all boys, calling all girls

Don't touch me now
Don't hold me now
Don't break the spell, darling
Now you are near
Look in my eyes and speak to me
The special promises I long to hear
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito, mi amor
Love me slow and gently
One foolish world, so many souls
Senselessly hurled through
The never ending cold
And all for fear and all for greed
Speak any tongue
But for God's sake we need
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito, mi amor
Let me know this night and evermore
This room is bare
This night is cold
We're far apart, and I'm growing old
But while we live
We'll meet again
So then, my love
We may whisper once more
It's you I adore
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito, mi amor
Touch me now
Las palabras de amor
Let us share the words of love
For evermore, evermore
For evermore

Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
You're taking all the sunshine away
Making out like you're the main line (I knew that)
'Cause you're a cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh just cruising
Driving along like the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart, huh!
Feeling the beat of my heart
Ooh you're a cool cat
Coming on strong with all the chit chat
Ooh you're alright
Hanging out and stealing all the limelight
Ooh messing with the beat of my heart yeah!
Ooh you used to be a mean kid
Ooh making such a deal of life
Ooh you were wishing and hoping and waiting
To really hit the big time
But did it happen? Happen, no!
You're speeding too fast, slow down
Slow down, you'd better slow down, slow down
You really know how to set the mood
And you really get inside the groove
Cool cat tapping on the toe with a new hat
Ooh just cruising
Driving along like the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart
Feeling the beat of my heart, yeah!
Feeling the beat of my heart
Can you feel it?
Feeling the beat of my heart
Feeling the beat of my heart
Ooh feeling, feeling, feeling
Feeling every feeling.

Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh
Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da, that's okay
It's the terror of knowing what the world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
"Let me out!"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets
Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
Okay
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Be lap
People on streets
Ee da de da de
People on streets
Ee da de da de da de da
It's the terror of knowing what the world is about
Watching some good friends screaming
'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?
Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love (people on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure

I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly (radio)
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (radio)
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (radio)
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo

I don't want my freedom
There's no reason for living with a broken heart
This is a tricky situation
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life
It can happen to any one
You win, you lose
It's a chance you have to take with love
Oh yeah, I fell in love
But now you say it's over and I'm falling apart
Yeah yeah
It's a hard life
To be true lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love
I try and mend the broken pieces
Oh, I try to fight back the tears
Oh, they say it's just a state of mind
But it happens to everyone
How it hurts (yeah) deep inside (oh yeah)
When your love has cut you down to size
Life is tough on your own
Now I'm waiting for something to fall from the skies
I'm waiting for love
Yes it's a hard life
Two lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love
Yes it's a hard life
In a world that's filled with sorrow
There are people searching for love in every way
It's a long hard fight
But I'll always live for tomorrow
I'll look back at myself and say I did it for love (oh)
Yes I did it for love
For love
Oh I did it for love

Oh yeah
I'm gonna take a little walk on the wild side
I'm gonna loosen up and get me some gas
I'm gonna get me some action
Go crazy, driving in the fast lane
My baby left me alone
She done me dirty and I'm feeling so lonely
So come home, come home
If you don't you're gonna break my heart
Man on the prowl
You better watch out
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble
So look out (yeah yeah) - look out (yeah yeah)
I'm a man on the prowl
I don't wanna be a rock 'n' roll steady
I just wanna be low down trash
I wanna go to the movies
All I wanna do is sit on my ass - ooh
So honey come home (come home come home)
Don't leave me when I'm feeling so lonely
Come home (yeah yeah) - come home (yeah yeah)
If you don't you're gonna break my heart
Man on the prowl
You better watch out
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble
So look out (yeah yeah) - look out (yeah yeah)
'Cause I'm a man on the prowl

It's a machine's world.
Don't tell me I ain't got no soul.
When the machines take over,
It ain't no place for rock'n'roll.
They tell me I don't care,
But deep inside I'm just a man.
They freeze me, they burn me,
They squeeze me, they stress me.
With smoke-blackened pistons of steel they compress me,
But no one, but no one, but no one can wrest me away.
Back to humans.
We have no disease, no troubles of mind.
We are fighting for peace, no regard for the time.
We never cry, we never retreat.
We have no conception of love or defeat.
What's that machine noise?
It's bytes and mega chips for tea.
It's that machine, boys
With random-access memory.
Never worry, never mind.
Not for money, not for gold.
Its software, its hardware,
Its heartbeat, its time-share,
Its midwife's a disk drive,
Its sex life is quantised.
Its self-perpetuating a parahumanoidarianised.
Back to humans.
Back to humans.
Back to machines.

This is the only life for me - yeah
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness 'cause love is all you need
Love is all you need
Do you know what it's like to be alone in this world
When you're down and out on your luck and you're a failure
Wake up screaming in the middle of the night
You think it's all been a waste of time
It's been a bad year
You start believing everything's gonna be alright
Next minute you're down and you're flat on your back
A brand new day is beginning
Get that sunny feeling and you're on your way (way)
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Do you know how it feels when you don't have friend (friend)
Without a job and no money to spend
You're a stranger
All you think about is suicide
One of these days you're gonna lose the fight
You better keep out of danger - yeah
That same old feeling just keeps burning deep inside (inside)
You keep telling yourself it's gonna be the end
Oh - get yourself together
Things are looking better everyday (day)
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
This is the only life for me - yeah
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourselves
Forget all the sadness 'cause love is all you need
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourselves
Forget all the sadness 'cause love is all you need yeah

Yeah
Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
Yeah, we're just waiting for the hammer to fall, yeah
Oh every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face the Western way
Build your muscles as your body decays, yeah
Tow the line and play their game
Yeah, let the anesthetic cover it all
'Til one day they call your name
You know it's time for the hammer to fall
Rich or poor or famous 
For your truth it's all the same
(Oh no, oh no)
Oh, lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane
(Oh no)
Hey yeah, baby, now your struggle's all in vain, yeah
For who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the Mushroom Cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder
What the hell are we fighting for?
Ah, just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
Yeah, while you're waiting for the hammer to, hammer to fall
Hey, yes
Let's get on the floor, yeah
Hammer
You know
Hammer to fall
Yeah
Hey, woo hoo
Ha ha, ha ha
I've been waiting for the hammer to fall
Give it to me one more time

Just look at all those hungry mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need
Is this the world we created?
What did we do it for
Is this the world we invaded
Against the law
So it seems in the end
Is this what we're all living for today
The world that we created
You know that everyday a helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by
Wooh, is this the world we created?
We made it all our own
Is this the world we devastated, right to the bone
If there's a God in the sky looking down
What can he think of what we've done
To the world that he created

Just one year of love
Is better than a lifetime alone
One sentimental moment in your arms
Is like a shooting star right through my heart
It's always a rainy day without you
I'm a prisoner of love inside you
I'm falling apart all around you, yeah
My heart cries out to your heart
I'm lonely but you can save me
My hand reaches for to your hand
I'm cold but you light the fire in me
My lips search for your lips
I'm hungry for your touch
There's so much left unspoken
And all I can do is surrender
To the moment just surrender
And no one ever told me that love would hurt so much
Ooh yes it hurts
And pain is so close to pleasure
And all I can do is surrender to your love
Just surrender to your love
Just one year of love
Is better than a lifetime alone
One sentimental moment in your arms
Is like a shooting star right through my heart
It's always a rainy day without you
I'm a prisoner of love inside you
I'm falling apart all around you
And all I can do is surrender

Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, oh yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure everybody knows
One day we love each other then we're fighting one another all the time
When I was young and just getting started
And people talked to me they sounded broken hearted
Then I grew up and got my imagination
And all I wanted was to start a new relation
So in love but love had a bad reaction
I was looking for some good old satisfaction
But pain is all I got when all I needed was some love and affection
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
Pain and pleasure
Ooh, ooh, pain and pleasure
When your plans go wrong - you turn out the light
But inside of your mind you put up a fight
Where are the answers that we're all searching for
There's nothing in this world to be sure of anymore
Some days you're feeling good, some days you're feeling bad
But if you're feeling happy someone else is always sad
Let the sweetness on love wipe the tears from your face
For better for worse, so let's make the best of the rest of our years
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, I told you so
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
Pain and pleasure, ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
All your life
Ooh ooh ooh
Pain - pleasure - pain - pleasure - pain - pleasure - pain - pleasure

Sweet moment set aside for us
Who wants to live forever?

But touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips
And we can have forever

It's criminal how I can
See right through you

When love breaks up
When the dawn light wakes up
A new life is born
Somehow I have to make this final breakthrough
Now
I wake up
Feel just fine
Your face
Fills my mind
I get religion quick
'Cause you're looking divine
Honey, you're touching something; you're touching me
I'm under your thumb, under your spell, can't you see?
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough, oh yeah
Break through these barriers of pain
Break through to the sunshine from the rain
Make my feelings known towards you
Turn my heart inside and out for you now
Somehow I have to make this final breakthrough
Now, oh yeah
Your smile speaks books to me
I break up
With each and every one of your looks at me
Honey, you're starting something deep inside of me
Honey, you're sparking something this fire in me
I'm outta control
I want to rush headlong into this ecstasy
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough
Oh yeah
Breakthrough, breakthrough
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough
Breakthrough

Rain Must Fall
I can see it in your stars
Life is so exciting,
Acting so bizarre
Your world is so inviting
Playing really cool
And looking so mysterious
Your every day is full of sunshine
But into every life a little rain must fall.
Anyone who imagines
They can blind you with science
Bully you all over
With property and finance
But you have position
To call the shots and name the price
You found success and recognition
But into every life a little rain must fall
You lead a fairy tale existence
But into every life a little rain must fall
Others seem to think
You are over dramatising
Problems at work
So it's hardly surprising
There's little you can do
To alter their opinions
You want a clean reputation
But now you're facing complications
'Cos into every life a little rain must fall

Scandal - now you've left me all the world's gonna know
Scandal - they're gonna turn our lives into a freak show
They'll see the heart ache, they'll see the love break
They'll hear me pleading, We'll say for God's sake
Over and over and over again
Scandal - now you've left me there's no healing the wounds
Hey scandal - and all the world can make us out to be fools
Here come the bad news, open the flood gates
They'll leave us bleeding, we'll say you cheapskates
Over and over and over again
So let them know when they start it's just a private affair
They'll have us hung in the air and tell me what do they care
It's only a life to be twisted and broken
They'll see the heart ache, they'll see our love break - yeah
They'll hear me pleading, I'll say for God's sake
Over and over and over and over again
Scandal scandal
Scandal
Scandal yes you're breaking my heart again
Scandal yes you're loving on out again
Today the headlines tomorrow hard times
And no-one ever really knows the truth from the lies
And in the end the story deeper must hide
Deeper and deeper and deeper inside
Scandal scandal
Scandal scandal

Don't let go, don't lose your mystique,
Wait a little longer,
Tomorrow brings another feast,
Don't let go, don't lose your reputation,
Thank god you're still alive,
You're still in one piece,
Hang on in there, don't lose your appetite,
Hang on in there, forget the danger signs,
Fray for that magical moment and it will appear
(Don't fight for lost emotions, )
Wait for the sunrise,
And everything will seem so clear,
(Look straight ahead, look straight ahead, )
Hang on in there, hang on in there, hang on in there,
Your wish will be granted,
All your problems will disappear,
Don't be a fool, you haven't reached your peak,
You got a fast car racing up inside you,
Your life is incomplete,
Hang on in there, hang on in there,
Fray for that magical moment and it will appear
(Wait for that moment),
Wait for the sunrise,
Just wait and see and it will seem so clear,
Let's go, let's go - OK now do the change now,
Yeah, hang on in there,
Hang on in there etc.


One two three four
Ooh ooh
While the sun hangs in the sky and the desert has sand
While the waves crash in the sea and meet the land
While there's a wind and the stars and the rainbow
Till the mountains crumble into the plain
Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
Tread that fine line
Oh, we'll keep on trying
Yeah
Just passing our time
Oh oh
While we live according to race, colour or creed
While we rule by blind madness and pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition, superstition, false religion
Through the eons and on and on
Oh, yes, we'll keep on trying, yeah
We'll tread that fine line
Oh oh we'll keep on trying
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Through the sorrow all through our splendor
Don't take offence at my innuendo
Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh
Duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh
You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo, be free, be free
Surrender your ego be free, be free to yourself
Oh oh, yeah
If there's a God or any kind of justice under the sky
If there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die
Ha, if there's an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask
Show yourself destroy our fears release your mask
Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
Hey, tread that fine line
(Yeah) yeah
We'll keep on smiling, yeah
(Yeah) (yeah) (yeah)
And whatever will be will be
We'll just keep on trying
We'll just keep on trying
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Till the end of time

When the outside temperature rises
And the meaning is oh so clear
One thousand and one yellow daffodils
Begin to dance in front of you, oh dear
Are they trying to tell you something?
You're missing that one final screw
You're simply not in the pink my dear
To be honest you haven't got a clue
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened, happened
It finally happened, ooh woh
It finally happened, I'm slightly mad
Oh dear 
I'm one card short of a full deck
I'm not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck
I'm not my usual top billing
I'm coming down with a fever
I'm really out to sea
This kettle is boiling over
I think I'm a banana tree
Oh dear
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad (I'm going slightly mad)
It finally happened, happened
It finally happened, uh huh
It finally happened, I'm slightly mad
Oh dear
Uh uh ah ah
Uh uh ah ah
I'm knitting with only one needle
Unraveling fast it's true
I'm driving only three wheels these days
But my dear, how about you?
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened
It finally happened, oh yes
It finally happened
I'm slightly mad
Just very slightly mad
And there you have it

And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal

Hoop diddy diddy hoop diddy do
Now you've got soup in the laundry bag
Now you've got strings, you're gonna lose your rag
You're gettin' in a fight
Then it ain't so groovy when you're screaming in the night
Let me out of this cheap 'B' movie
Headlong down the highway and you're rushing
Headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping and you can't stop rockin'
And there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can
Nothin' you can do about it
When a red hot man meets a white hot lady
Hoop diddy diddy hoop diddy do (ho)
Soon the fire starts a raging gets 'em more than half crazy
Hoop diddy diddy hoop diddy do

I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
I can't let you stay
Ooh but I can't live if you go away
I don't know just how it goes
All I know is I can't live with you
Yeah I'm having a hard time
I'm walking a fine line between hope and despair
You may think that I don't care
But I traveled a long road to get hold of my sorrow
I tried to catch a dream
But nothing's what it seems
Love is saying baby it's all right
When deep inside you're really petrified
Lover turns to hater
On this escalator
I can't live with you, yeah
But I can't live without you
I can't breathe if you stay
But I can't bear you to go away
I don't know what time it is
All I know is I can't live with you
We're stuck in a bad place
We're trapped in a rat race
And we can't escape
Maybe there's been some mistake
We're trying to make a high score
We're walking through a closed door
And nobody's winning
We're just sinning against ourselves
Hold on baby tell me it's all right
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside
Passions screaming hotter
Doin' what we gotta do, yeah
I can't live with you I can't live with you
I can't live I can't live
I can't I can't live with you
But baby I'll never ever leave you
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
Cause I'm in love with you
Ooh and everything about you
I can't live with you
No I just can't live I just can't live
I can't live with you
Yeah and I can't live without you
Through the madness through the tears
We've still got each other
For a million years, yeah
Ooh yeah
Yeah, I can't live without you, yeah yeah
I can't live without you
Yeah yeah, oh oh oh
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
Oh oh, I can't live without you, baby baby baby
Without you
I can't live without you

If you're searching out for something
Don't try so hard
I you're feeling kind of nothing
Don't try so hard
When your problems seem like mountains
Feel the need to find some answers
You can leave it for another day
Don't try so hard
But if you fall and take a tumble
It won't be far
If you fail you mustn't grumble
Thank your lucky stars
Just savor every mouthful
And treasure every moment
When the storms are raging round you
Stay right where you are
Oooh don't try so hard
Oooh don't take it all to heart
It's only fools they make these rules
Don't try so hard
One day you'll be a Sergeant Major
Oh you'll be so proud
Screaming out your bloody orders
Hey but not too loud
Polish all your shiny buttons
Dressed as lamb instead of mutton
But you never had to try
To stand out from the crowd
Oh what a beautiful world
Is this the life for me
Oh what a beautiful world
It's the simple life for me
Oooh
Oh don't try so hard
Oh don't take it all to heart
It's only fools they make these rules
Don't try so hard
Don't try so hard
Don't try so hard

Sometimes I get to feelin'
I was back in the old days, long ago
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect, you know?
The days were endless, we were crazy, we were young
The sun was always shinin', we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately, I just don't know
The rest of my life's been, just a show
Those are the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you
You can't turn back the clock, you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame?
Ooh, I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately, I just don't know
Better sit back and go, with the flow
These are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now but some things remain
When I look and I find, no change
Those were the days of our lives, yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true
When I look and I find, I still love you
I still love you

Delilah, Delilah, oh my, oh my, oh my - you're irresistible - ooh ooh ooh
You make me smile when I'm just about to cry
You bring me hope, you make me laugh - and I like it
You get away with murder, so innocent
But when you throw a moody you're all claws and you bite
That's alright!
Delilah, Delilah, oh my, oh my, oh my - you're unpredictable - ooh ooh ooh ooh
You make me so very happy
When you cuddle up and go to sleep beside me
And then you make me slightly mad
When you pee all over my Chippendale suite
Ooh ooh Delilah
Ooh ooh Delilah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You take over my house and home
You even try to answer my telephone
Delilah, you're the apple of my eyes
Meow, meow, meow,

And I go out of my mind - ooh ooh

My Bijou

Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore?
The show must go on
The show must go on
Yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning (I'm learning), I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning (turning, turning, turning), 'round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
The show must go on
The show must go on (yeah yeah)
Ooh, inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
Yeah
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly my friends
The show must go on, yeah
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show 
Ooh, I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on 
(On with the show, on with the show)
Show (show must go on, go on)
