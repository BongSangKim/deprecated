We investigate the non-linear dynamics of superparamagnetic beads moving around the periphery
of patterned magnetic disks in the presence of an in-plane rotating magnetic field. Three different
dynamical regimes are observed in experiments, including (1) phase-locked motion at low driving
frequencies, (2) phase-slipping motion above the first critical frequency fc1, and (3) phase-insulated
motion above the second critical frequency fc2. Experiments with Janus particles were used to confirm that the beads move by sliding rather than rolling. The rest of the experiments were conducted
on spherical, isotropic magnetic beads, in which automated particle position tracking algorithms
were used to analyze the bead dynamics. Experimental results in the phase-locked and phaseslipping regimes correlate well with numerical simulations. Additional assumptions are required to
predict the onset of the phase-insulated regime, in which the beads are trapped in closed orbits;
however, the origin of the phase-insulated state appears to result from local magnetization defects.
These results indicate that these three dynamical states are universal properties of bead motion in

I. INTRODUCTION

Controlling the transport of micron and sub-micron
diameter colloidal beads as carriers in aqueous fluids is of
great interest for myriad biological applications. Several techniques have been developed to control bead motion, based on
optical tweezers,1–3 electromagnetic tweezers,4,5 dielectrophoresis,6,7 acoustic traps,8,9 and on-chip micromagnets.10–15 In
particular, the ability to control large numbers of beads in parallel, by employing an external field and magnetizable features patterned in substrates, shows high potential for
remotely organizing single particles and cells on on-chip.
Many applications require the ability to separate colloidal components based on size or some other physical or
chemical properties. Hence, there has been great interest in
exploiting the non-linear dynamics of bead motion in translating potential energy landscapes. The separation mechanism is typically based on tailoring the balance between the
applied force and hydrodynamic resistance for different
sized particles. This approach has been studied previously in
colloidal suspensions interacting with arrays of optical
traps,16,17 or in periodic magnetization patterns exposed to a
time-varying magnetic field.10–12,14,18–22 Magnetic separation, in particular, has notable advantages including its biocompatibility, absence of magnetic shielding from the
environment, the wide selection of commercially available
magnetic beads, and finally its ability to apply strong forces
remotely to colloidal particles without significant heating or
other deleterious effects.

There have been several prior studies of magnetic bead
motion through periodic potential energy landscapes. In
one example, micron sized beads have been sorted in a
quasi-1D potential energy landscape induced by an array of
ferromagnetic disks exposed to a magnetic field rotating in
the xz-plane.21–23 In another example, magnetic beads are
transported through a 2D energy landscape induced by a
hexagonal array of cylindrical magnetic “bubble” domains
in uniaxial ferrite garnet films exposed to a conical magnetic field profile.18,24,25
The non-linear dynamics of bead motion through periodic lattices has also been studied both theoretically and
experimentally.21,26 Prior theoretical investigations were
motivated by the experimental discovery of a third dynamical regime,14 in which magnetic beads were observed to
enter into closed orbits, exhibiting effectively zero timeaveraged translational motion across the substrate. This
“phase-insulated” state is not predicted by the classical
dynamics of synchronization behavior in a monochromatic
non-uniform oscillator,27 which spurred the development of
new theoretical models to understand this dynamical regime
for its potential in a high resolution magnetic separation.
Simulations first showed that the inclusion of multiple
interacting oscillators was found to adequately predict the
phase-insulated state, as well as the onset of quasi-periodic
velocity states, resembling a “devil’s staircase.”21 These predictions were later confirmed in experiments,26 which
showed clear quasi-periodic phase locking behavior, as well
as the existence of the phase-insulated state above a critical
frequency. However, it is far from clear whether the phaseinsulated regime exists just in this previously studied system,

or whether these dynamics are universally present in other
types of non-linear dynamical systems.
Here, we demonstrate another example of this nonlinear dynamic behavior in a system of magnetic beads
exposed to an array of patterned disks of soft permalloy
(NiFe), which are driven by an in-plane rotating field. Unlike
prior studies, in which the magnetic beads experience
strongly varying magnetic field profiles during translational
motion, we investigate a system in which the magnetic field
profile is weakly varying, and in some cases, quasi-static,
within the translating reference frame of the bead. Even in
this system, we show the existence of phase-locked, phaseslipping, and phase-insulated regimes. We speculate that the
origin of the phase-insulated regime is caused by the slight
inhomogeneity in the shape or magnetization profile of the
disks in a horizontally rotating magnetic field. This rationale
is supported by the observation that magnetic beads stick
preferentially to specific sites on the magnet, where there
may be a defect or other irregularity. Since it is impossible
to fabricate perfect magnetization patterns, these results suggest that particles translating through slightly irregular
potential energy landscapes will universally experience these
three dynamical regimes and provide improved control
mechanisms for achieving high resolution separation
between different types of beads.14
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS

Experimental work employed commercially available
superparamagnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin,
InvitrogenTM, Cat. No. 142.03), with a mean diameter of
2.8-lm, which were dispersed in an aqueous medium containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant and localized by a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) well. The magnetic
susceptibility of the beads was measured to be v ¼ 0.7 in the
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID).28
Janus particles were used in order to determine whether the
particle underwent sliding or rolling motion. The Janus particles were prepared by creating monolayer of 8-lm superparamagnetic beads (SpheroTM, Cat. No. CM-80-10) on a
silicon wafer, onto which a 100-nm Au layer was evaporated
(Denton DV-502 E-gun Evaporator). After re-suspending the
beads in water, the gold layer allowed the rotational motion
of the bead to be optically tracked.
An array of disks was patterned on silicon substrates,
using direct current sputtering system of 100 nm thick permalloy (Ni82.6Fe17.4) followed by photolithographic liftoff.12
The patterned substrates were then coated with 500 nm film
of Teflon (DupontTM, Grade 601S2-100-6) by spin coating at
3500 rpm for 30 s. As shown in Fig. 1, four solenoid coil
magnets were used to produce the in-plane rotating magnetic
field controlled by LabVIEW (National Instruments) by supplying two sinusoidal currents with 90 phase difference in
x- and y-axis, respectively. The samples were placed at the
center of the imaging plane in a microscope (LV-UEPI,
Nikon). A Gaussmeter (Lakeshore 450) was positioned under
the sample to monitor the phase angle of the rotating field,
with the angle in the positive x-direction assumed to be the
reference point of 0 . The bead trajectories were recorded

with a video camera (Guppy Pro F-031, Allied Vision) with
a frame rate up to 123 fps, which was controlled by the software FireCapture 2.1. A Matlab code was used to track the
position vector of the bead center relative to the disk center.
The angle made between this position vector and the x-axis
represents the bead phase angle. The phase lag is defined as
the difference between the bead phase angle and the external
field angle, which describes how far the bead lags behind the
translating potential energy landscape.
III. THEORETICAL MODEL AND SIMULATIONS

In an externally applied field (Happ), magnetic beads are
trapped by the field gradients near the periphery of the
micro-magnetic disks. The beads are attracted towards the
high field regions, where the magnetostatic potential energy
is minimized. The minimum energy locations are shifted
around the disks by applying a rotating field in the xy-plane,
which causes the magnetic beads to follow the circulating
energy minima. The phase lag of the bead relative to the

horizontal field axis is denoted as u, and the radial distance
of the bead away from the center of the magnet is denoted as
q. The forces on the bead are projected along the orthogonal
coordinates in the cylindrical coordinate system, where the
force tangential to the bead’s path is denoted as Fu, whereas
the radial force is Fq.
The theoretical model is explained in detail elsewhere;12,29 however, in brief, we use semi-analytical approximations to represent the magnetic field of thin disks, which
are used to capture the shape-induced demagnetization.
Although the approximation comes at the cost of numerical
precision, it reduces the computational burden to obtain
more feasible trajectory calculations. It is assumed that the
permalloy film is magnetically soft (i.e., no hysteresis). Thus
the magnetic film can be treated as a surface pole distribution
along the exterior of the magnetic film, which means that the
volumetric pole density within the interior is ignored.
Furthermore, the film is approximated as infinitely flat,
which means collapsing the surface pole distribution into a
one-dimensional magnetic line pole distribution around the
perimeter of thin disks. The resulting magnetostatic potential
can be written as

Other friction forces known to be involved in the transport
dynamics include the static and kinetic sliding friction forces
between the bead and substrate, Ff, which may induce the
bead to roll, as depicted in Fig. 2. However, these other friction forces are difficult to experimentally characterize. Thus,
we assumed that the dissipation was produced entirely by a
viscous drag force with a best-fitting effective viscosity used
to match the experimental trajectories. The rotational motion
of the bead was ignored, since the bead was observed to
move by sliding rather than rolling (see Fig. 3).
Particle trajectories were simulated with a finite difference time domain analysis, using the force balance from
Equations (4) and (5) to determine the instantaneous velocity. Numerical convergence was achieved in simulations by
employing a suitably small time step which determines the

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

By tracking the bright and dark regions of the Janus
bead as a function of time, shown in Figs. 3(b)–3(f) and supplementary movie 1, it is clear that the Janus bead motion
undergoes phase-locked sliding motion around the disk of 10
and 30 lm diameter (Multimedia view).
The three regimes of bead motion observed in experiments are shown in Fig. 4 and supplementary movie 2, when
exposed to a 2 mT rotating external field applied at different
frequencies (Multimedia view). At a driving frequency of
0.8 Hz, which is below the critical frequency fc1, the bead
rotates synchronously around the perimeter of the micromagnet with a fixed phase difference of 27 between the
instantaneous bead position and the external field direction
(see Figs. 4(a)–4(d)). This dynamic mode is known as the
“phase-locked” regime, because the bead’s phase lag is
locked in time. The bead trajectory for the phase-locked regime is also displayed in Fig. 5(a), where the red circles
denote the phase angle of the external field, while the black
squares denote the bead’s phase angle. The bead phase lag,
i.e., difference between the field angle and bead position, is
shown by the grey triangles in the inset of Fig. 5(a), which is
phase-locked at 27 for the stated operating conditions.
Phase locked motion results from the balance between
the magnetic force and the viscous and frictional drag. As
the driving frequency is increased, the higher bead velocity
causes it to experience a stronger viscous fluid drag, which
increases the bead phase lag. When the bead phase lag
reaches the critical condition of 45 ,30 the bead can no longer

phase-locked with the external field at a driving frequency of 0.8 Hz. In panels (e)–(h), the bead undergoes phase-slipping motion at a driving frequency
of 1.2 Hz. In panels (i)–(l), the bead is in a phase-insulated state at a driving
frequency of 20 Hz. (Multimedia view) [URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/

remain in the phase-locked state. The driving frequency
associated with this first transition is denoted as fc1.
At a driving frequency of 1.2 Hz, which is above the first
critical frequency, fc1, the bead enters the “phase-slipping
regime,” which is described as such because the phase difference between the external field direction and the bead position can no longer be constant. Experimental images of the
phase-slipping motion are shown in Figs. 4(e)–4(h), and the
trajectory is plotted in Fig. 5(b).
Finally, at a driving frequency of 20 Hz, which is above
the second critical frequency, fc2, the bead oscillates about a

static, fixed position on the perimeter of the magnet.
Experimental images of the bead’s motion are shown in
Figs. 4(i)–4(l), and the trajectory is plotted in Fig. 5(c). This
dynamic regime is denoted as the “phase-insulated regime,”
because the bead does not follow the external field, and thus
behaves similarly to an electrical insulator.
The experimental bead trajectory in the phase-slipping
regime in the presence of a 2 mT field, which rotates in the
clockwise direction at a frequency of 1.2 Hz, is depicted in
Fig. 6(a), where the white circles show the trajectory of the
bead as a function of time. Experimental trajectories correspond well with the simulated bead trajectories shown in
Fig. 6(b), assuming the volumetric magnetic susceptibility of
the bead is 0.7,28 and the relative magnetic permeability of
the permalloy patterns is lr ¼ 113.12 Rather than directly
evaluating the various forms of friction, we assumed that the
dissipation was produced by an effective viscous drag force
using a best fitting viscosity of 0.012 mK Pas. The radial
position of the beads is plotted in Fig. 6(c) as a function of
time, where the jumping behaviour is attributed to a repulsive radial force Fq that occurs at specific time points in the
cycle, depending on the instantaneous phase lag of the
bead.30 The experimentally observed radial position as a
function of time agrees well with the numerically simulated
positions, shown in Fig. 6. In the phase-locked and phaseinsulated regimes, on the other hand, the radial position
maintains a constant value throughout the motion.
Fig. 7 shows the phase diagram for the frequency and field
dependent behaviour of magnetic beads exposed to field

lines). The second critical frequency, fc2, divides the phase-slipping and

the maximum velocity of the beads in the phase-locked regime. And the

strengths ranging from 0 to 5 mT and frequencies ranging from
0 to 120 Hz. All experiments here were averaged for 30 beads
to obtain reliable statistics. The critical frequency (fc1) distinguishing the transition between the phase-locked and phaseslipping regime was observed to increase quadratically with
the field magnitude, which is expected based on the unsaturated magnetic properties of the beads and film below 5 mT.
The inset graph of Fig. 7 displays the maximum velocities
(2pqfc1) of the rotating beads for different fields, evaluated by
the critical frequencies, fc1, and the measured distance q away
from the disk center. For the field strength of 5 mT, the beads
velocity can be as high as 250 lm/s (fc1 ¼ 7.1 Hz). The red
line in Fig. 7 depicts the transition between the phase-slipping
and phase-insulated regimes, which occurs at critical driving
frequencies, fc2. The critical frequency for the 5 mT rotating
field was measured to be 90 Hz. The criterion for determining phase-insulated motion was based on identifying the minimum frequency for which beads were unable to move during
a time period of 10 s. The shape of the second transition curve
is similar to the first transition curve, increasing quadratically
with the field magnitude.
Our experiments suggest that the phase-insulated regime
results from inhomogeneity in the angle-dependent magnetization of the disks. Classical theory of a non-uniform oscillator suggests that if the magnetization strength of the disk is
~
independent of the field angle (i.e., if jMðhÞj
¼ const:), then
the particle will never enter the phase-insulated regime except
at infinitely high frequencies.27 However, if there is a magnet~
ization defect in the disk pattern (i.e., if jMðhÞj
6¼ const:), it
can act as a pinning site to trap the bead at a critical point in
the cycle, and thereby prevent it from making forward progress around the disk. Evidence for the presence of pinning
sites has been observed in our experiments, wherein the magnetic bead becomes trapped at the same location on a given
magnet, regardless of the initial conditions and field

application protocol. This effect can be observed in supplementary movie 3 and the inset microscope image of Fig. 7, in
which the external driving frequency is ramped between 1 Hz
and 20 Hz, and the bead becomes trapped at one specific location (Multimedia view). Since it is impossible to fabricate
defect-free lithographic patterns, this observation suggests
that the phase-insulated regime can be exploited to achieve
high resolution separation between different types of beads.
V. CONCLUSION

In summary, we study the non-linear dynamics of beads
moving around lithographically patterned NiFe disks. We
observe three different dynamical regimes in the presence of
an in-plane rotating magnetic field: including a phase-locked
at low frequencies, a phase-slipping regime above the first
critical frequency fc1, and phase-insulated regime above the
second critical frequency fc2. Our experiments with Janus
particles demonstrated that bead motion occurs by sliding
rather than rolling motion, which allows the system to be
modeled with point particle dynamics. The experimental
bead trajectories in the phase-slipping regime correspond
well with numerical simulations. Moreover, the presence of
the phase-insulated regime appears to be caused by defects
in the angle-dependent magnetization of the disks. This
result lends further support to the expectation that these three
dynamical regimes will be present in any physically realizable system for bead transport and suggests that the optimal
pathways to tune the frequency of the phase-insulated regime
are by breaking symmetry in the shape or adjusting the
defect density in the magnets. These results may find use in
the development of new systems for separating magnetic
beads and cells on-chip. For example, using our half-disk
pathway,10–12 different kinds of magnetic beads in the magnetization or scale could be separated due to the different
critical frequencies of the bead dynamics.
