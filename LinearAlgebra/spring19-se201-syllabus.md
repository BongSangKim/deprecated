## Course Description
This is an introductory course on linear algebra.
Linear algebra studies systems of linear equations and properties of vectors and matrices, and is useful in natural science and engineering, economics, social science, and especially in machine learning and optimization.
I will introduce basic concepts and properties in linear algebra and matrix theory,
as well as how to compute matrix algebra by *Python programming*. 
As an application, I will explain how neural network and *natural language processing*(NLP) works via `word2vec` algorithm.

## Course Objectives
This course expects all students to fully understand the material covered in the class. 
At the end of class, successful students will
* understand basic concepts in linear algebra;
* have mathematical proficiency. That is, students are able to write and communicate mathematics in a higher level;
* be able to use Python to compute matrix computation;
* understand the neural network, and be able to construct a mathematical model using it;
* be able to initiate their own researches on NLP.

## Prerequisites and Texts
There is no formal prerequisite for this course.
However, it may help to understand contents covered in *Differential Equations and Applied Calculus*(SE101) and *Multivariable Caclulus*(SE102).
Our official textbook is

## Assessments and Grading
The grades are based on two exams(midterm and final), homeworks, research project on NLP, and class participation. Percentages are the following.
* Midterm (30\%)
* Final (30\%)
* Homeworks (15\%)
* Project (15\%)
* Class participation (10\%)

The table below shows the schematic of the final grade. If the total score is greater than or equal to 90, then the final grade is A+. If the total score is strictly less than 90 and greater than or equal to 80, the final grade will be A0, and so on.

| Total Score | 90 | 80 | 75 | 65 | 55 | 50 | 40 | 30 | 25 | 15 | 5  | 0  |
| ----------- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Grade       | A+ | A0 | A- | B+ | B0 | B- | C+ | C0 | C- | D+ | D0 | D- |


## Exams
There are two exams in this course.
Midterm and final will be on 8th and 16th weeks respectively. 
Exact date,time, and place for exams will be announced 1-2 weeks ahead.
The content of the exam will be different from the other sections of the same course..

The exam evaluate how students understand the materials covered in the class.
Students must write as detail as possible in their solution.
There will be questions on computation, as well as questions on explaining mathematical concepts. 
Every solution must be written in full sentences with valid logic.
There might be a questions which asks students to collaborate with each others during the exam.
In such circumstance, specific instruction will be provided in the exam.

Midterm and Final are the crucial components for the final grade.
*If you do not take midterm or final, you will fail the course*. 
Based on 5-point scoring system, each question will be graded by the following scheme.

* (5 points) The solution is written by complete sentences and delivers correct answer with flawless mathematical ideas. The solution contains detail explanation of the how the answer is obtained.
* (4 points) The solution is written by complete sentences and uses correct ideas and theorems. However, it misses a few detail or makes small mistakes. The solution may contain some flaw or logical gaps, which are not crucial part of the answer.
* (3 points) Student explains their work in detail, but uses a wrong/incorrect idea/theory. Or they come up with partially wrong answer. Otherwise, the conclusion of the solution is correct, but it has no detail explanations.
* (2 points) There is no detail explanation, nor conclusion/answer in the solution. Students vaguely show their ideas, which are not entirely wrong.
* (1 point) The solution contains no complete sentences, or logical explanations. However, it contains a partially correct statement of the theorems relevant to the problem.
* (0 point) Students attempt to use completely wrong idea and false statement. Solution contains no logical statement at all.

## Homework
There will be 9 homeworks throughout the semester.
The homework consists of mathematical proof and computation, as well as Python programming exercises.
The homework should be submitted through [LMS](http://lms.dgist.ac.kr).

You must scan your work in pdf format and upload the pdf file to designated website.
There are many apps for scanning document by your smart phone.
If you have not used such apps, I recommend using: 

* [Adobe Rader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.reader)
* [Adobe Scan](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.scan.android)

Due dates are written in the *Class Schedule* below. Deadlines are 23:59 of each due date. (1 minute earlier than the midnight!) Due to the internet traffic, you must start upload your homework at least 10 minute before midnight. When the homework is submitted late, 50\% of the total points will be deducted per day. There is no exception on late policy. Your homework will be graded by 0/1/2 scales. 2 points for submitting homework on time, 1 point for less than 24 hours late, and 0 point for missing or more than 24 hours late homework.

Doing your homework by yourself is extremely important. By doing homework problems, you will re-master the materials covered in class by lecture and recitation sessions. You will be asked to write and solve questions covered in homework too. Thus an act of cheating, copying, and plagiarism in homework assignment will lead to failing the course. 


## Project
During the semesetr, each student will initiate a project on NLP *individually or within a group* using `word2vec`. 
Since it is a tool for categorizing words with respec to the meanings of the words, the title of your work should be

> Analysis on Word Vectors in `...`

The `...` in the title can be a database (such as wikipedia), literatures (such as 'Pride and Prejudice'), or a collection of literatures (such as 'Shakespeare'). **The context must be in English.** (We will use the package `gensim`, which is optimized for English words.) You must choose
the context which you want to analyse the word within, and the type of analysis. For example, the following research could be done:
* (Title) Analysis on Word Vectors in `American Dramas in '90s and '00s.'
* (Abstract) We compare the most commonly used words in American Dramas in '90s and '00s, and how the meaning of the words have been changed during the decade.   

Each group (or individual) must choose their own subject of the research and use *Python* language. (No other programming languages are allowed.)

Your result will be evaluated by 1-page report ~~10-minute presentation~~ at the end of semester. At the end of semester, I will select 12 exemplary results and give opportunity to make a 10-minute presentations. 
In the report, you must explain your research topic, research questions, and methods they used for solving the problem.
The following is the grading scheme.
* (Originality) The work must contains an original interpretation / conclusion.
* (Effectiveness) The research have an impact to other research area or real life. 
* (Mathematics) The plan and methods of research must be logical and based on concrete mathematical theories and models.

## Class Participation
The class participation is evaluated by number attendances in class.
Each time a student misses, or late a class, 1\% of the grade will be lowered.
**If you miss or late to class more than 10 times, you will fail the course.**
For exemption, you must provide an official documents (such as a doctor's note, or an organization's official letter, etc)

## Class Schedule
There are two 75-minute lectures and a 50-minute recitation session each week. 
In the lecture, we will learn mathematical backgrounds on linear algebra.
In recitation session, we will learn python programming and backgrounds on NLP. 
You are expected to be well-prepared before attending the class.
The lecture will be delivered in both English and Korean. 
The first half of the lecture will be delivered in English and recorded. 
The second half of the lecture will be delivered in Korean and will not be recorded.
