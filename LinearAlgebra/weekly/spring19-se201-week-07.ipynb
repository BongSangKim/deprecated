    "    * Three types of elementary row / column operations: (1) multiply c on a row / column and add to another row / column, (2) multiply one row / column, (3) switch two rows / columns.\n",
    "    * If $L$ is an elementary row operation matrix of the type (1), then $\\det(LA) = \\det(A)$. Likewise, if $U$ is an elementary column operation matrix of the type (1), then $\\det(AU) = \\det(A)$ (Prop 2)\n",
    "    * If $P$ is an elementary row / column operation matrix of the type (2), then $\\det(PA) = \\det(AP) = -\\det(A)$. ($P$ corresponds to a permutation which switches two rows, and $\\det(P) = -1$)\n",
